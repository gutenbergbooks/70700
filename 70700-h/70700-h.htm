</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The expedition</span> of which an
account is given in the following pages was undertaken in the year
1871, and it was originally intended that a narrative of the
proceedings should be given to the public soon after our return to
England. Sir Joseph D. Hooker, who made careful notes throughout
the journey, hoped to complete the work without much delay, and
actually wrote the greater part of the first two chapters; but the
constant demands upon his time arising from his official duties at
Kew, and the important botanical works to which he is a chief
contributor, further increased by his election, in 1873, to the
Presidency of the Royal Society, so far interfered with the
completion of the original design as to compel him to request his
fellow-traveller, Mr. Ball, to undertake the completion of the
work. The latter was at the time engaged in preparing for
publication a memoir on the Flora of Marocco, which has since
appeared in the Journal of the Linnæan Society, wherein the
botanical collections made during the journey are enumerated and
described; and his performance of the task allotted to him has been
further delayed by several prolonged absences from England.</p>

<p>As regards many countries visited by travellers a delay of
several years in publication might seriously affect the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span> accuracy of a narrative intended
to represent the existing condition of the country and its
inhabitants; but in the case of Marocco, where, from a comparison
with the accounts of early travellers, no notable change is
apparent during the last two centuries, the effect of a few years’
interval may be considered insensible. Up to the date of our visit
the Great Atlas was little better known to geographers than it was
in the time of Strabo and Pliny; and it may be hoped that whatever
interest belongs to our journey is as great now as it was at the
moment of our return.</p>

<p>The narrative now published is mainly founded on the journals
kept by Sir J. Hooker and Mr. Ball, supplemented in some
particulars by that of our fellow-traveller, Mr. G. Maw. To the
latter we owe a sketch of the Geology of Marocco, which appears in
the Appendix. Along with this we have published some interesting
contributions received from Mr. H. B. Brady and Mr. Freeman Bogers,
as well as some papers upon various matters connected with the
physical geography and the flora of Marocco.</p>

<p>It is impossible to present these pages to the public without
repeating the expression of our obligations to some of those to
whose assistance we largely owe whatever success we were able to
attain. Foremost amongst these we must name H. E. Sir John Drummond
Hay, K.C.B., British Minister Plenipotentiary in Marocco. From the
moment when, in compliance with the request of Sir J. Hooker, Lord
Granville, then Foreign Secretary, instructed our Minister to apply
for the permission of the Sultan to visit the Great Atlas, Sir J.
D. Hay, by his extensive knowledge of the country and the people,
and by his great personal influence, afforded invaluable assistance
to the expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>We were also
much indebted for assistance and hospitality to the British
Consular agents on the Marocco coast, and especially to the late
Mr. Carstensen, then Vice-Consul at Mogador. We should not omit our
acknowledgments of the courtesy and valuable information received
from the late M. Beaumier, French Consul at the same port.</p>

<p>We trust that in the course of the following pages we have not
omitted to express our thanks to other friends who have kindly
contributed valuable information. The scope of this volume being
mainly to give an account of our personal experience and
observations, we have used, but sparingly, other materials, which
might be in place if we had aimed at the production of a work of a
more elaborate character.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> Saturday, April 1, 1871,
our party, consisting of Sir Joseph (then Dr.) Hooker, Mr. Maw, and
Mr. Ball, with a young gardener, named Crump, from the Royal
Gardens at Kew, left Southampton for Gibraltar, in the Peninsular
and Oriental Company’s Steamship <em>Massilia</em>.</p>

<p>Even for the ordinary tourist it is a pleasant thing to turn his
face towards the South in the early part of the year, and to feel
that he is about to exchange six or eight weeks of bitter easterly
winds for the bright skies and soft breezes of the Mediterranean
region. Still more does the botanist rejoice to quit the poverty of
our slowly unfolding spring flora for the wealth of varied
vegetation that is spread around the shores of the Inland Sea. But
for us, the occasion was one of deeper and more special interest.
We were starting, under unusually favourable conditions, to explore
a country which, though close to Europe, is among the least known
regions of the earth. Although the obstacles we were sure to
encounter and the limited time at our disposal, might not allow us
to accomplish much,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> we
felt a confident hope that we should learn something of a great
mountain chain all but absolutely unknown to geographers, and be
able to fill up some missing pages in the records of our favourite
science. The thrill of pleasurable anticipation at the prospect of
setting foot within the boundaries of <i>terra incognita</i> was
heightened by the fact that for each of us this land of Marocco had
long been the object of especial interest and curiosity.</p>

<p>From an early period Hooker had conceived the desire to explore
the range of the Great Atlas, to become acquainted with its
vegetation, and to ascertain whether this supplies connecting links
between that of the Mediterranean region and the peculiar flora of
the Canary Islands. This desire was increased during a journey in
Syria, in 1860, made in company with Admiral Washington, the late
Hydrographer of the Navy, one of the very few Europeans who had
reached the flanks of the Great Atlas chain, when, as a young naval
officer, he accompanied the late Sir John Drummond Hay on his
mission to the city of Marocco in 1829.</p>

<p>Maw had already made collections of living plants in the
neighbourhood of Tangier, and had also visited Tetuan, where he had
pushed his excursions farther than any but one preceding
traveller.</p>

<p>Ball had landed at Tetuan in 1851 with the hope of attaining
some of the higher summits of the neighbouring Riff Mountains; but
the disturbed state of the country in that year made it impossible
to advance beyond the immediate outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>From the moment when it seemed likely that the permission to
visit the Great Atlas sought for by Hooker, through the
intervention of our Foreign Office, would be accorded by the Sultan
of Marocco, no time was lost in making the requisite preparations.
Although everything was done within about a fortnight, our
equipment was tolerably complete; and when, after the first
excitement of departure had subsided, we thought it over on
board<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> ship, we found
but one serious omission to deplore. Two mercurial barometers,
provided by Hooker, had been entrusted to Crump, and were by him
left behind at the last moment. Thus, in the important matter of
determining heights, we were forced to rely upon aneroid barometers
and boiling water observations. It was fortunate that Ball carried
an excellent aneroid, by Secrétan of Paris, which has before and
since been severely tested in the Alps with very satisfactory
results, and whose indications during our journey agreed closely
with those given by the thermometer in boiling water.</p>

<p>Among the various preparations made for our journey there was
none more important for our purpose than a manuscript catalogue of
all the plants hitherto known or believed to have been found in the
Empire of Marocco, which we owed to the kindness of our excellent
friend M. Cosson, the eminent French botanist. Up to that date the
information to be found in books was extremely scanty, and
scattered throughout various systematic works, and the whole when
summed up would have given a most incomplete account of the two or
three districts partially explored by botanists. M. Cosson, by his
unequalled knowledge of the North African flora, and by careful
study of all the collections made in Marocco, many of which are in
his exclusive possession, was the only person who could have
supplied the materials which were so serviceable throughout our
journey.</p>

<p>In the agreeable society of old friends and new acquaintances,
whom we met on board the rather crowded steamer, the voyage to
Gibraltar did not appear too tedious, but we were well pleased
when, on the afternoon of the 6th, the moment came for landing.</p>

<p>We were not destined to see much of the famous ‘Rock’ or its
native ‘scorpions,’ whether biped or hexapod. Scarcely had our
voluminous baggage been transported to the hotel, when news reached
us that an English steamer was about to sail within two hours for
Tangier,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> and we at once
decided that not a moment’s time should be wasted. Back again our
heavy goods, in which botanical paper was a chief ingredient, were
carried to the mole, and after paying the innkeeper a pretty heavy
ransom, on account of rooms ordered but not used, and a hastily
swallowed dinner, we once more found ourselves afloat. So much
haste was not necessary, for the steamer did not start till some
time after midnight; but the time was not badly spent, for the
steamer was one of those that ply between London and the Canary
Islands, touching at the ports on the Atlantic coast of Marocco;
and the skipper, who was an old stager, and had formed his own
opinions about the country, had plenty of information, of a more or
less authentic, but mainly discouraging, character, which he was
most ready to impart.</p>

<p>The distance from Gibraltar to Tangier is not more than
thirty-five miles, and we came to anchor in the open roadstead soon
after daylight on April 7. Unlike the ports on the Atlantic coast,
the shape of the land here gives some protection from the
prevailing westerly seas and winds; but in other respects this is a
bad one. The ruined mole, round which sand has accumulated, forms
on one side a dangerous reef, and elsewhere the shore shelves very
slowly to a moderate depth. Ships of any burthen are forced to lie
out far from shore, and the landing from boats is usually effected
on the backs of Jews, inasmuch as no Moslem will degrade himself by
performing such a service for a Christian.</p>

<p>On Good Friday the Jews were all engaged in the ceremonies of
the Passover; but, as the sea was unusually calm, we were able to
land on the ruins of the mole, and, after floundering through
slippery seaweed, we were not long in reaching the sea gate of the
city.</p>

<p>We had already perceived that, although no longer in Europe, we
were yet under the shadow of European manners and customs. High
above the city walls we espied, as we neared the shore, several
conspicuous inscriptions,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_5">[5]</span> announcing the titles of various places of
entertainment. In the centre the ‘Hôtel de France’ gave promise of
culinary skill; but we preferred the ‘Royal Victoria Hotel,’ whose
title, in quite gigantic letters, first attracted our notice, and
which had been well recommended for cleanliness and comfort. Our
subsequent experience justified the choice, and we had every reason
to be satisfied with the attention we received from the intelligent
and obliging coloured proprietor, Mr. Martin.</p>

<p>Tangier stands on the western side of a shallow bay, on rocky
ground that rises steeply from the shore. Westward the hills
gradually rise in swelling undulations towards the Djebel Kebir, or
Great Mountain, covered with dwarf oaks and flowering shrubs, that
ends in the promontory of Cape Spartel. On the opposite, or
eastern, side the shores of the bay are low and sandy, but are
backed by the rugged range of the Angera Mountains, culminating in
the Ape’s Hill opposite Gibraltar.</p>

<p>As seen from the sea the town has a singular, though not an
imposing, appearance. Cubical blocks of white-washed masonry, with
scarcely an opening to represent a window, rise one above another
on the steep slope of a recess in the hills that faces the NE. A
few slender square towers belong to as many mosques of paltry
proportions. Numerous consular flagstaffs remind the European that
he still enjoys the protection of his own government, and on the
summit of the hill a massive gaunt castle of forbidding aspect
shows where he might expect to lodge if that protection were
removed, and he were to give offence to the native functionaries.
Zigzag walls encompass the city on all sides, pierced by three
gates, which are closed at nightfall.</p>

<p>The stranger, who knows that Tangier is one of the most
important towns of Marocco, and the residence of the
representatives of the chief civilised States, is apt to be shocked
when he first sets foot within its walls. The main street is as
rough and steep as the most neglected of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_6">[6]</span> Alpine mule-tracks, and disfigured by heaps of
filth—importunate beggars of revolting aspect, led about by young
boys, assail him at every step—there is no bazaar, as in eastern
towns, and the miserable shops are mere recesses, where, in an
unglazed opening, little larger than a berth in a ship’s cabin, the
dealer squats surrounded by his paltry wares.</p>

<p>On longer acquaintance, he will somewhat modify his first
unfavourable impression. Unlike the towns of Southern Europe, where
the main thoroughfares are cared for by the local authorities,
while filth is allowed to accumulate in the byeways, the dirt and
offal are here let to lie under his nose in the most public places,
while the steep narrow lanes—reminding him of Genoa—that intersect
the masses of closely packed houses, are generally kept clean and
bright with frequent whitewash. The silent dead walls that front
the public thoroughfares conceal the interiors of houses that are
rarely opened to the eyes of Europeans, but are not wanting in the
signs of wealth and of artistic taste. The dread of arbitrary
exactions, that elsewhere in Marocco drives the Moor as well as the
Jew to conceal the possession of property as carefully as men
elsewhere hide the evidence of guilt, is less keenly felt here. For
in and around Tangier, but nowhere else in this country, it may be
said that life and property are tolerably secure, not only from
outward violence, but from the caprice and cupidity of men in
authority. The presence of foreign diplomatic agents, and the
constant communication with Europe, have brought the Moorish
authorities at this spot to some extent under the control of
civilised opinion, and the disastrous encounters with France and
Spain have convinced the Moor that, with all his personal bravery,
he cannot resist the regular forces of his European neighbours, and
must not provoke an unequal conflict.</p>

<p>Such historical recollections as are connected with<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span> Tangier are not flattering to the
self-love of the two nations of Europe that have had most to do
with it.</p>

<p>In 1437 the Portuguese, who then held Ceuta, attacked the town,
but their army was defeated under the walls, and they were forced
to conclude an ignominious peace. The terms included the cession of
Ceuta to the Moors, and the delivery as a hostage of Dom Fernando,
the king’s brother. The other stipulations not having been
executed, the victors threw Dom Fernando into prison at Fez, and
when he died in captivity hung up his body by the heels over the
city walls.<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The fortune of war was changed in 1471 when the Portuguese took
Tangier and several of the towns on the Atlantic coast, and the
Moorish Sultan was forced to pay tribute to King Emanuel. Under
less vigorous guidance, the Portuguese were unable to retain their
ascendancy, but they kept possession of Tangier till, after nearly
two centuries, it was, by a secret treaty, ceded to England as part
of the dowry of Catharine of Braganza on her marriage with Charles
II. When the brave Governor Dom Fernando de Menezes received the
information, he entreated the Queen Regent to spare him the grief
of seeing the city made over to the enemies of the Catholic faith.
Her answer was the offer of a Marquisate if he obeyed, and
dismissal from her service if he persisted in resisting her will.
He chose the latter, threw up his command, and devoted the rest of
his life to writing a history of the city. The English Court set
great store by the new acquisition, believing, as the Earl of
Sandwich said, that if it were walled and fortified with brass it
would yet repay the cost. But English policy was then at its lowest
ebb, and neither vigour nor intelligence directed any branch of our
affairs. The English settlers sent out were an ill-conditioned
rabble, ignorant of the country, its<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_8">[8]</span> language and manners, and the Governor and the
garrison were no better than the rest. After accomplishing one
useful work by constructing a mole that converted the roadstead
into a secure harbour, they were disappointed in their expectation
of an extensive trade with the interior, and, what was more
galling, were worsted in every encounter with the Moors, till, in
1685, the Government in London decided to abandon Tangier. When
this became known at Lisbon, the Portuguese strongly urged the
impolicy of abandoning such a position to pirates, and requested
that it should be restored to them on condition that the English
should have free use of the port. With characteristic meanness and
imbecility the Duke of York—soon afterwards James II.—opposed the
gift, and urged that the honour of England required that the place
should be dismantled, and be left for occupation to whoever could
hold it. His advice prevailed; and, on the retirement of the
English force, the mole was effectually blown up, destroying the
only good harbour for shipping on the seaboard of Marocco—a
distance of fully nine hundred miles.</p>

<p>Nature, however, has made Tangier the port of North Marocco,
and, in spite of human perversity, it is a place of some
importance. Ready access to the fertile provinces lying between the
Straits of Gibraltar and Fez has made it the centre of a
considerable trade in hides and grain, which go to France and
England, to say nothing of cattle and other supplies for the
garrison of Gibraltar. Its nearness to Europe has made it the
residence of the representatives of the principal civilised Powers,
and its admirable climate has attracted invalids from Gibraltar and
elsewhere, in spite of such drawbacks as dirt, bad smells, and the
utter absence of roads.</p>

<p>On our arrival, we were most kindly received by Sir John
Drummond Hay, to whose intimate knowledge of the country and justly
acquired influence with the Moorish Court we are largely indebted
for whatever success attended<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_9">[9]</span> our journey. We learned from him that the
Sultan had issued orders to the Governor of the Atlas provinces to
allow Hooker to visit the range of the Great Atlas south of the
city of Marocco, and to take every precaution for his comfort and
safety; but he added that, although there was no reason to doubt
the Sultan’s good faith, every artifice would be used to defeat the
object, and that it would not be prudent to start for the south
without an autograph letter from the Sultan himself, for which he
had already made application. The Court was at this time at
Fez—several days’ journey from Tangier; and, as business moves at a
slow pace in this country, it was probable that we might have to
wait some time for the necessary document. We therefore at once
decided on devoting the interval to excursions in the neighbourhood
of Tangier and Tetuan. The latter city lies at no great distance
from the lofty peaks of the <i>Beni Hassan</i>, probably the
highest part of the north-western range of the Lesser Atlas, best
known as the Riff Mountains. There could be no doubt as to the
botanical interest attaching to a visit to that range, the higher
region of which is entirely unknown to naturalists, and we were
very desirous to make an attempt in that direction. After full
consideration, however, Sir J. D. Hay felt it necessary to object
to our project, as involving undue risk. The Riff mountaineers
enjoy a virtual independence, merely paying tribute to the Sultan.
They are fierce and fanatical; and the presence of a Christian on
the highest mountain, which is rendered sacred by a famous
<i>marabout</i>—tomb of a Mohammedan saint—would be regarded as a
profanation. Meantime, we were led to hope that we should be able
to ascend the mountains nearer to Tetuan, and there was no
difficulty whatever about excursions in the neighbourhood of
Tangier.</p>

<p>Our first walk, in the afternoon of the 7th, was in the
agreeable society of Sir J. D. Hay, to Ravensrock, his summer
residence, on the wooded slope of the Djebel<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[10]</span> Kebir, overlooking the straits. Near the
city gate we passed the cemetery, where turbaned tombstones almost
disappear amidst the copious growth of prickly pear (<i>Opuntia
vulgaris</i>), and then went some way through dusty lanes between
lines of American aloe (<i>Agave americana</i>), and quickset
hedges surrounding gardens where palms, acacias, and a few poplars
were the prevailing trees. As we cleared the enclosures, and got
into irregular, open ground, where steep slopes of uncultivated
land alternate with patches of tillage, our eyes were gladdened by
the sight of many a bright southern flower, already blossoming
abundantly, in spite of the weather which, till lately, had been
unusually cold. Trefoils, Medicagos, vetches, and other leguminous
plants were here the predominant forms, as they are everywhere in
the spring flora of the Mediterranean region. As we began to ascend
the flanks of the Djebel Kebir, the character of the vegetation
changed. Where the ground has not been cleared to make a garden for
some of the European residents, whose little villas are scattered
over the slope, the ground is covered with masses of luxuriant
shrubs, and climbing herbaceous plants, among which some familiar
forms of the North are mingled with many exotic species. Thus we
saw roses, brambles, bryony, honeysuckle, and white convolvulus
holding their ground amidst masses of lentisk, myrtle, Phillyrea,
Alaternus, dwarf prickly oak (<i>Quercus coccifera</i>), gum
cistus, and the golden profusion of five or six species of the
<i>Cytisus</i> tribe that replace our native broom and gorse. After
ascending several hundred feet by the roughest of paths, carried
along a shaded gully, we entered through a gate the terraced garden
whereon stands the house.</p>

<p>Nothing of its kind can surpass the beauty of the view. The
steep slope below is planted with oranges and pomegranates—the
first laden with golden fruit, the second with crimson
flowers—broken here and there by palms, figs, olives, and carob
trees, standing against a background of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_11">[11]</span> deep blue water, dancing in the gentle
westerly breeze. On our left the steep slope of the mountain,
rising over against the blue outline of Cape Trafalgar, forms the
portal through which the Atlantic pours its current into the
Mediterranean. Along the opposite shore of Spain every undulation,
from the coast to the distant purple sierra, is plainly seen. The
little town of Conil and the very houses of Tarifa are discernible
with the naked eye, and visitors are enabled through a glass to
watch the people as they come and go, and that extraordinary
phenomenon for Southern Spain, the diligence, that of late years
has plied between Algeciras and Cadiz. Turning to the right, the
eye reaches the entrance to the Mediterranean, between the rock of
Gibraltar and the loftier summit of Ape’s Hill; and in clear
weather the range of the Serrania de Ronda, stretching towards
Malaga, is seen on one side, while on the other the snowy peak of
the Beni Hassan, south of Tetuan, closes the view. To give variety,
if that were wanting, there is the ceaseless passage of shipping
through this greatest of maritime highways, in a double stream of
vessels, of every size and every nation, from the great Peninsular
and Oriental steamer to the Moorish felucca. It is an example of
the readiness with which sound travels over an unbroken surface,
that the morning and evening gun at Gibraltar, nearly forty miles
distant, are usually heard at this spot.</p>

<p>In the course of several delightful evenings passed in the
agreeable society of Sir J. D. Hay and his family, we obtained much
curious and valuable information respecting the country and its
inhabitants, most of which was confirmed by our own subsequent
observation and experience. We already knew that Marocco is the
China of the West, and that while other Mohammedan States have been
drawn, though at a tardy and halting pace, into following the
general movement of European progress, this has remained more
isolated and more impenetrable than even the Celestial Empire
itself. But we were scarcely prepared<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_12">[12]</span> to find that the utmost excesses of barbarism
are matters of daily occurrence in a country so close at hand; and
though we had read startling statements in the books of preceding
travellers, and heard confirmatory tales during our stay in North
Marocco, we were inclined to think that, at the worst, these
referred to solitary acts of cruelty, probably magnified by the
proverbial tendency to exaggerate all that is strange and horrible.
It was not until we had spent some time in the southern provinces,
beyond the reach of European prying observation, that we could
persuade ourselves that these terrible stories of cruelty and wrong
merely give a true representation of the ordinary condition of the
country. Sir J. D. Hay, who probably knows it better than any other
European, was not slow to testify to the good qualities of the
rural population of Marocco, and the general absence of crime. We
were afterwards led to believe that if life and property may be
said to be tolerably secure throughout the portion of the empire
really subject to the Sultan’s authority, this is due rather to the
fact that temptation is rare, and the danger of swift and bloody
retribution imminent, than to the existence of any high moral
standard among the people. It is a strange inversion of all notions
of government, that crime should come from above rather than below,
and that the dread that men feel for the safety of their persons
and goods is directed rather to the constituted guardians of order
than to the outcasts from society. The first feeling of one unused
to a barbarous government is surprise that it should be allowed
even to exist, much more that it should possess considerable
stability, and be handed on from one generation to the next,
without a general outburst of resistance. Observation tends to
explain this seeming enigma. Bad as it may be, the oppression
exercised by the few strikes only those who are in some way
conspicuous. The common mass, who offer no special temptation to
extortion, escape comparatively unhurt, and feel little sympathy
for the victim. Accordingly it is only when a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_13">[13]</span> Sultan or a Governor indulges in mere
gratuitous acts of cruelty against his humbler subjects, that we
hear of a general revolt. Oppression is, after all, less
intolerable than anarchy; and at that very time most men would have
chosen to live in Marocco rather than in Sicily.</p>

<p>Among other objects of interest Sir J. D. Hay showed us a
coloured view of the Great Atlas range, as seen from the
neighbourhood of the city of Marocco, executed at the time of his
father’s mission to that city in 1829, and this naturally engaged
our special attention.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The most singular point in the structure
of the mountains was a very long range of what were represented as
precipitous rocks of seemingly uniform height and structure, that
appeared to rise abruptly from the plain, and to form an almost
continuous outer wall or rampart on the north side of the chain. We
were also shown a copy of Hollar’s<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> rare engraving, representing
Tangier at the period of the English occupation, with the soldiers
of Charles II., in their cumbrous uniforms, strutting on the
mole.</p>

<p>Those who have read his interesting and lively little work,
‘Morocco and the Moors,’ will not be surprised that so keen a
sportsman and close an observer of the habits of wild animals as
our host should have many curious anecdotes to tell; but we were
not prepared to hear that less than twenty-five years before a lion
had been killed close to the spot where his beautiful villa now
stands. At the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
present time no animal of prey larger than a jackal is seen in this
part of the country, but the wild boar is as abundant there as it
is everywhere throughout Marocco. No doubt the religious scruples
that forbid the use of the flesh have gone far to prevent the
natives from reducing the numbers of these mischievous brutes. One
anecdote in favour of an animal whose moral character stands in low
repute may here be permitted.</p>

<p>Sir J. D. Hay had brought up a young leopard in his house until
the animal had reached his full size and strength, and it seemed a
scarcely safe companion for the younger members of his family. He
therefore resolved to present it to the Zoological Gardens in
London, where it was duly installed. Some two years later, when on
a visit to England, its former master bethought him of the leopard,
and, going to the gardens, recognised the animal and spoke to him
in Arabic. The once familiar sounds immediately awoke the animal’s
memory, and it at once displayed the appearance of unbounded, but
joyous, excitement. On explaining the circumstances the cage was
opened, and the animal showed the utmost delight at the approach of
its early friend and master.</p>

<p>On the night of Easter Sunday, while enjoying the cool air and
the view from the roof of the British Residency, we beheld that
grand display of the Aurora Borealis, which was visible at the same
time throughout Western Europe. As in the equally brilliant auroras
of the preceding autumn, which the popular imagination in many
different parts of Europe had attributed to the burning of Paris,
the characteristic feature of this display was the pale flickering
crimson tinge that rose from the northern and western horizon
towards the zenith. Brilliant auroral phenomena are rarely seen in
so low a latitude as Tangier; but thirty-two years earlier Hooker
had beheld them from a still more southern station, during the
visit of the Antarctic Expedition to Madeira in 1839, as described
by Sir James Ross in the narrative of that voyage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>We were much
impressed by the accounts we received of the remarkable salubrity
of the climate of North Marocco, and we gathered abundant evidence
to the same effect in regard to other parts of the territory.
Nothing is more rare than to find a country where neither the
natives nor foreign visitors have any complaint to make against the
climate, and in that respect Marocco is almost unique. As regards
the season of our visit, however, our case was that of nearly all
travellers in whatever country they may find themselves. We had
arrived in an exceptional season! How often is this fact gravely
stated as something remarkable and unusual in the experience of the
narrator, whereas, if he would but reflect, it merely represents
the common experience of mankind in most countries of the earth!
Excepting some portions of the equatorial zone, where the seasons
recur with tolerable constancy, our notions of the climate of a
place are got at by taking an average among a great many successive
seasons. It is true that our own islands afford an extreme instance
of variability; but elsewhere in the temperate zones of both
hemispheres, the difference between corresponding seasons in
successive years is often very great. Any one who watches the
meteorological notices published in our newspapers, must be aware
that if any particular day, week, or month be compared with the
general average for the same period during a long term of years, he
will find it to be either considerably hotter, or colder, or drier,
or moister than the corresponding average day, week, or month; and
when registers shall have been kept for a sufficient time in other
countries, the same result will be seen to hold good, though in a
somewhat lesser degree. Travellers will then be prepared to find
that they should expect to enjoy or suffer from an exceptional
season, and will think it more remarkable when they happen to
alight on a season that approaches near to the average. That
preceding our visit had been unusually severe; snow had been seen
at Tangier, and had lain for some hours on the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_16">[16]</span> rock of Gibraltar, and, as a consequence
affecting the object of our journey, the spring vegetation in North
Marocco was unusually retarded. At the same time, so far as our
sensations went, nothing could be more agreeable than the climate
of this season, the thermometer in the shade during the day varying
from 60° to 66° Fahr., and the air being delightfully clear and
bracing.</p>

<p>On April 8 we started for a short excursion to the headland of
Cape Spartel. In the immediate neighbourhood of Tangier Europeans
may safely walk or ride unattended; but, as we were going a little
beyond the ordinary limits, it was considered prudent to give us
the escort of two soldiers, and to these we added a baggage mule
and a native guide. In a botanical sense we were about to travel
over beaten ground—the only spot in all Marocco where a naturalist
can without difficulty wander at will over rocky hills that retain
their natural vegetation. The little that was then known of the
flora of the empire would have dwindled to a scanty list if we had
struck out the rich collections that successive botanists during
the last 100 years have brought from the Djebel Kebir and the
adjoining hilly district west of Tangier. Although there was little
prospect of new discovery, the expedition could not fail to offer a
veritable feast to a botanist, and especially to one not already
familiar with the vegetation of the opposite coast and the
adjoining region of southern Portugal.</p>

<p>After standing the fire of some harmless ‘chaff’ from the Jew
and Moorish boys that loitered about the city gate, we soon got
clear of the enclosures near the town, and descended through
cultivated land into a little grassy valley that lies below the
hilly range of the Djebel Kebir. Bright spring annuals—blue and
yellow lupen, crimson Adonis, a deep orange marigold (<i>Calendula
suffruticosa</i>), blue pimpernel, and other less conspicuous
flowers—enlivened the tillage ground; but the northern botanist is
more struck by the perennial species that hold their
ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> on the large
portion of the soil which the plough has not touched. Predominant
among these, as elsewhere throughout a large part of the
Mediterranean region, is the palmetto, or dwarf palm (<i>Chamærops
humilis</i>). Where unmolested by animals, and protected from the
periodic fires that the native herdsmen renew for the sake of
getting herbage for their cattle, it forms a thick trunk, ten or
twelve feet in height, which probably takes a long time to attain
its full size; but in the open places it is commonly stemless, and
covers the ground with its radiating tufts of stiff fan-shaped
leaves. Many plants of the lily tribe abound; but in this mild
climate most of them had flowered in winter, and few now showed
more than their tufts of large root-leaves. Most conspicuous is the
large maritime squill (<i>Scilla maritima</i> of Linnæus). The
flowers are not large or showy, and do not correspond with the size
of the bulb which often equals that of a man’s head. Another
species of the same genus (<i>Scilla hemisphærica</i>) is more
ornamental, as are the two common asphodels. The slender iris
(<i>I. Sisyrhynchium</i> of Linnæus), whose delicate flower lasts
only a few hours—opening one at a time on successive days,
appearing about mid-day and withering in the afternoon—is very
abundant.</p>

<p>On reaching the hollow ground, where a slender stream runs
through damp meadows, we were charmed by the delicate tint of a
pale blue daisy that enamels the green turf. It is merely a slight
variety of the little annual daisy (<i>Bellis annua</i>), so common
in many parts of Southern Europe; but the blue tint does not seem
to have been noticed elsewhere. The larger blue daisy, afterwards
seen as one of the ornaments of the mountain region of the Great
Atlas, was at first supposed to belong to the same species; but,
besides that this is perennial, it shows other less obvious
differences.</p>

<p>It was on the slopes of the Djebel Kebir, where the stony ground
is almost exclusively occupied by a dense mass of small shrubs, few
of them rising more than three<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_18">[18]</span> or four feet from the ground, but nearly all
covered with brilliant flowers, that we first began to seize the
really characteristic features of the North Marocco flora. A great
variety and abundance of flowering perennials of shrubby habit is,
indeed, a distinguishing feature of the whole Mediterranean region;
but very little observation was needed to show that we were here in
that well marked division that includes Southern Portugal,
South-western Spain, and the opposite corner of Africa. This may be
called for distinction the Cistus and Heath region; for though most
of the same kinds of Cistus and Helianthemum extend as far as the
south of France, and many species of heath inhabit the Atlantic
coasts of Europe as far north as Connemara, it is only here that
both these tribes flourish together, and give a prevailing
character to the vegetation. Most conspicuous of all is the
gum-cistus (<i>C. ladaniferus</i>), which in the Sierra Morena and
the adjoining parts of Spain and Portugal obtains such predominance
that for twenty miles together one may ride through a continuous
thicket where the peculiar scent of the gum that covers the leaves
and young branches is never absent. About Tangier the rich purple
spot that usually adorns the base of the large petals is wanting,
and the flowers show unmixed snowy white. Of the same tribe,
besides several true <i>Cisti</i>, there are many species of
<i>Helianthemum</i>. Of heaths, along with the commoner kinds
(<i>Erica arborea</i> and <i>E. scoparia</i>), we saw in abundance
the rarer and more characteristic forms, <i>E. australis</i> and
<i>E. umbellata</i>. <i>E. ciliata</i>, one of our English
rarities, is here very scarce, though it grows on the opposite side
of the Strait. Our common heather (<i>Calluna vulgaris</i>) still
holds its ground, but in a poor and stunted condition. The
rhododendron of the East (<i>Rh. ponticum</i>), that is at home in
the mountain region of Asia Minor and Syria, and which strangely
reappears here and there among the low hills between Tarifa and
Algeciras, on the north side of the Straits, has not been found on
the African shore; but<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_19">[19]</span> until the coast between Tangier and Ceuta has
become more accessible, it will not be safe to assume that it is
wanting. Among the many shrubby leguminous plants whose flowers
give the prevailing golden tint to the hill sides, two of the Broom
tribe (<i>Genista triacanthos</i> and <i>Cytisus tridentatus</i>),
plants of very peculiar aspect and characteristic of this region,
attracted our attention. It is impossible to omit another ornament
of the hills—a plant rather widely diffused but nowhere common
(<i>Lithospermum fruticosum</i>), whose azure blue flowers formed a
charming contrast with the surrounding masses of golden colour.</p>

<p>The botanical district to which the northern corner of Marocco
belongs has been already called that of the Cistus and Heath, but
no single species of those tribes exactly conforms to the limits
above pointed out. There are, however, several less conspicuous
plants whose distribution more closely agrees with those limits.
The most singular of these is the <i>Drosophyllum lusitanicum</i>,
a plant of the sun-dew tribe, whose branched stem bears several
large yellow flowers. The numerous slender strap-shaped
root-leaves, nearly a foot in length, that are gradually contracted
to the thickness of whipcord, are beset with pellucid ruby-tipped
glands, and present a peculiarity that appears to be unique in the
vegetable kingdom. Any one who has remarked the growth of ferns
must have seen that in the young state the leaves are rolled or
curled inwards, so that in the process of unfolding the face or
upper side of the leaf, which was at first concealed, is gradually
opened and turned to the light. A similar process occurs in many
other plants; but in <i>Drosophyllum</i> alone, so far as we know,
the young leaf is rolled or curled the reverse way, so that the
upper side of the leaf is that turned outwards. It appears to grow
in many parts of Southern Portugal; reappears on the north side of
the Straits of Gibraltar near Tarifa and Algeciras, and on the
southern side about Cape Spartel and on the hills above Tetuan,
where it commands a view of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_20">[20]</span> opening of the Mediterranean, but extends no
farther eastward. Very similar is the distribution in Europe of two
ferns whose natural home seems to be in the Canary Islands—the
graceful <i>Davallia canariensis</i>, and the <i>Asplenium
Hemionitis</i> of Linnæus. Both occur here and there in shady
spots, from the rock of Lisbon to Algeciras and Tangier, but are
unable to travel eastward beyond the Pillars of Hercules.</p>

<p>The scarcity of trees in this country is mainly due to the
mischievous interference of man. The same ignorant greed of the
herdsman, who to procure a little meagre herbage for goats sets
fire to wide tracts of brushwood, that has reduced whole provinces
of Spain to a nearly desert condition, has been equally busy and
equally effectual in Marocco. The evergreen oak, which might
produce much valuable timber, is the chief indigenous tree of this
country; but, except on the rocky western declivity of the hill
above Cape Spartel, few here arrive at a moderate growth, and the
same is true of the Portuguese oak (<i>Quercus lusitanica</i>). The
latter, indeed, never attains a considerable stature; but, where
preserved from damage, it forms thickets some twenty or thirty feet
in height, and, if duly protected, would help to preserve the hilly
districts of this region from being annually parched by the summer
sun. One of the shrubby evergreen oaks of this country (<i>Quercus
coccifera</i>, L.), whose dark green spiny leaves are more like
those of a holly than of an ordinary oak, might perhaps be
successfully introduced in the south-western parts of the British
islands. Its very dense foliage would make it valuable as a screen,
and it produces a good effect when mixed with other shrubs.</p>

<p>Although the distance did not exceed ten or twelve miles, we had
so much to do in filling our tin boxes and portfolios that the sun
was sinking in the Atlantic as we reached the lighthouse at Cape
Spartel. It is impossible not to feel some interest in this
structure that for so many a mariner marks the limit of the great
continent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> more than
three times the area of Europe, that remains, in spite of all the
efforts of modern enterprise, the chief home of all that is strange
and mysterious and unknown in the world. It represents, too, the
only concession that the Moor has made to the demands of modern
civilisation; for the building has been raised at the cost of the
Sultan of Marocco, though the expense of its maintenance is shared
between the four Powers, England, France, Italy, and Spain. The
representatives of these States at Tangier form a board of
management, and each in turn undertakes the actual control and
inspection of the building. It was by an especial favour, and on
the ground of our scientific pursuits, that we received permission
from the Spanish Consul-General, then Acting Commissioner, with the
concurrence of his colleagues, to lodge for the night within the
building. It stands on a rocky platform some 250 feet above the
sea. The massive tower, or pharos, that bears the lantern, is about
eighty feet in height, and, with the annexed building, is enclosed
by a strong wall, forming an outer court. The interior of the
building is singularly picturesque. An inner octagonal court,
surrounded by pillared arcades, supported on round, slightly
stilted arches, with a fountain of cool spring water in the middle,
gives access to the rooms, small and bare but perfectly clean, of
which three were given for our accommodation. Some fowls and eggs
supplied by the lighthouse-keeper, eked out by the provisions we
had carried from Tangier, produced an excellent supper, and the
evening was fully employed till a late hour in arranging and laying
out the spoils of our first day’s work in Marocco. It was near
midnight when, before turning in for the night, each in turn paused
in the court to enjoy the exquisite beauty of the scene. The full
southern moon poured a flood of silver light through the arched
spaces, converting the pattering spraydrops of the fountain into
pearls and diamonds. The shadows of the slender columns lay like
bars of ebony on the white flags; while, for a roof, the Great
Bear, every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span> star
twinkling its brightest, stretched upward towards the zenith. The
great tower rose in dark shadow, for the lantern was turned away
from us; but we could discern, streaming out to seaward, in spite
of the apparent clearness of the air, two faintly marked cones of
yellow light that were soon quenched in the moonlight. The air was
still, the sea was quiet, and at first the silence seemed unbroken;
but as the listener stood, the pulses of the great ocean, though
they smote but gently the cavernous rocks below, beat distinctly on
the ear, and marked the passing minutes.</p>

<p>We rose betimes next morning, finding fresh enjoyment in each
breath that we drew of the delicious air, and after breakfast set
out for a walk southward along the coast. For the first two or
three miles the rocky ground sloped downward towards our right, and
finally fell steeply to the beach. It was apparent that the season
was not quite advanced enough to enjoy the full beauty of the
flora, but we found, besides the <i>Drosophyllum</i> already
mentioned, many interesting forms. Orchids were not so abundant as
they usually are at this season in the warmer part of the
Mediterranean region. <i>Platanthera diphylla</i>, growing in shady
spots, was the only uncommon species.</p>

<p>An indentation of the coast marks the spot where a slender
stream descends to the sea through a stretch of white sand; and
beyond this the rocky coast rises but slightly above the sea level.
Our steps were directed towards the so-called Cave of Hercules.
This was originally a mere hollow in the face of the sea cliff; but
from a remote period of antiquity it has been quarried for the
purpose of extracting the hand-mills universally used in this part
of Marocco. These, which are quite the same as the Scotch
<i>querns</i>, are cut out in the rudest way by hammer and chisel,
leaving the surface of the rock marked by a series of circular
indentations about eighteen inches in diameter. In this way the
original dimensions of the cave have been greatly enlarged, and, as
it is still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> worked
for the same purpose, the process is sure to be continued. In
connection with the question raised of late years as to change of
relative level of land and sea within the historic period, we
observed some very ancient markings that showed the works to have
been carried somewhat below the present level of high tide; but we
could trace none that appeared to reach so low as that of the ebb
tide.</p>

<p>So far as the evidence at this point goes, it seems to prove a
slight amount of submergence during the period for which the rock
has here been quarried. This period may probably be reckoned at
2,000 years, and possibly much exceeds that limit. Taken in
connection with still existing remains in Greece, Asia Minor, the
Phœnician coast of Syria, and Egypt, it tends to show that the
changes in the general level of the Mediterranean coasts, indicated
by many geologists, must have proceeded very slowly during the
historic period, and that the more considerable oscillations, that
have undoubtedly occurred near Naples and on the east coast of
Sicily, have been mainly due to the local influence of volcanic
action.</p>

<p>The soil near the cave was much mixed with sand carried by the
wind, and the plants seen were chiefly widely diffused species that
find tolerably uniform conditions of life on the sandy shores of
the west coast of Europe. The rocks near the cave produce samphire
and the sea fern (<i>Asplenium marinum</i>), just as they do in
Cornwall; while <i>Diotis maritima</i> and <i>Lotus Salzmanni</i>,
a local variety of the widely spread <i>Lotus creticus</i> of
Linnæus, were frequent on the sands. The chief ornament was
<i>Statice sinuata</i>, whose delicate azure flowers were already
in blossom, long before most of the species of that late-flowering
genus.</p>

<p>Our course now lay inland; but, instead of following the direct
way back to Tangier, we were led by a false report (our first
experience of blundering interpretation of English by the help of
Moorish Arabic) to bear to the left, and recross the Djebel Kebir,
so as to take Sir J. D.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_24">[24]</span> Hay’s villa of Ravensrock on our way back to
the town. Near the track we passed close to a native village, or
<i>douar</i>, the first which we had seen. When we had heard that
the native population is broadly distinguished into two classes by
the fact that some retain their original nomadic habits so far as
to live permanently in tents, moving from one spot to another
during the course of the year, while the others live in houses, and
have become rooted to the soil, it never occurred to us that there
could be any difficulty in distinguishing between one class and the
other with the help of such obvious characteristic marks. But we
soon found that the difference is but slight, and not very
apparent. The black camel’s hair tent is often, both in seeming and
in fact, a more durable dwelling than the miserable huts, composed
chiefly of slender branches to which the dried leaves still adhere,
covered sometimes with brown straw, and oftener with some tattered
fragments of cloth, the remains of worn-out garments. Only the
mountain tribes, the descendants of the ancient Bereber stock,
whose southern descendants we were to become acquainted with in the
valleys of the Great Atlas, have preserved the familiar use of
stone masonry in this part of Africa. Laden with plants, and with
appetites sharpened by our climb over the hill, we returned to our
comfortable quarters at the Victoria Hotel. We did not pass over
the very highest point of the Djebel Kebir; but an observation
taken some sixty or eighty feet lower indicated an elevation of
about 800 feet above the sea level.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> April 10 we started,
rather late, for Tetuan, leaving our tents and heavy baggage at
Tangier. Our pompous interpreter, Hadj Bel Mohammed by name, whose
huge blue spectacles seem to be permanent appendages of the
Victoria Hotel, we found forward and intrusive in manner, and
indolent and inefficient in action, and altogether of no account as
a companion to travellers. Of the two soldiers who formed the
escort—one recognised by his taciturnity the inferiority of his
position; but the other by his quaint appearance and jocular
disposition afforded us much amusement, if not much reliable
information. This little fellow is properly called Hadj Mohammed,
but he seems to be familiarly known among the English visitors to
Tangier by the name of Bulbo. There was nothing military about him,
except a very long gun which, throughout our journey, remained
carefully covered up in an intricate red cloth case. If by any
chance his aid had really been required, and such an unlikely
suggestion were admitted as that Bulbo would have done anything
else than put spurs to his horse and run away, he would have been
driven to beg the attacking party to give him a quarter of an
hour’s delay to get ready for action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>The distance from
Tangier to Tetuan is only about forty miles; but we decided on
stopping for the night at the Fondak,<a id=
"FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a
solitary Moorish caravanserai, about thirty miles distant from
Tangier. Hurrying past the accumulations of offal and filth that
are shot over the seaward face of the city wall, and indulging in a
ten minutes’ gallop over the sandy beach, we left the seashore;
and, after riding some way through deep sandy lanes, before long
reached a stretch of low cultivated land that extends westward from
Tangier to the hills that divide this from the neighbouring
provinces of Laraish and Tetuan.</p>

<p>The season was not sufficiently advanced for the flowering of
many seaside plants; but there was quite enough to rejoice the eyes
of botanists who had escaped from the ghastly spring season of the
North when the days grow longer, but only more dreary, and the
bitter east wind parches and blasts the young leaves and blossoms
that are tempted to their destruction by the mildness of our winter
weather. As everywhere on the seaboard of Marocco, the great yellow
chrysanthemum (<i>C. coronarium</i>), with florets varying in hue
from orange to pale lemon colour, is conspicuous on sea banks, with
several fine species of Heron’s-bill (<i>Erodium</i>). In the sands
a large purple-flowered <i>Malcolmia</i> (<i>M. littorea</i>) and
many <i>Leguminosæ</i> already diversified the aspect of the
vegetation; while robust <i>Umbelliferæ</i>, mingled with the
familiar eryngo of our own shores, had as yet merely developed
their showy leaves.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But the characteristic form which chiefly
interests the stranger to this region is a grey leafless bush, with
long pendulous whipcord-like branches waving in the breeze, that is
common among the sandhills, and recurs elsewhere<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> in dry exposed situations. There
is something sad in the meagre and drooping aspect of the plant
that brings to mind those dismal mourning trinkets, wherein a lock
of hair is made to form the effigy of a weeping willow. This is the
R’tam of the Moors, whence botanists have formed the name
<i>Retama</i> for a small group of brooms, containing a few nearly
allied species, that are widely spread throughout the region
extending from Spain to the Canary Islands. In the early spring our
Tangier plant (<i>Retama monosperma</i> of Boissier) is covered
with clusters of small white odoriferous flowers. These had nearly
all disappeared, and were succeeded by little hard one-seeded pods,
which in some of the varieties ultimately become thick and fleshy,
and are much sought after by birds. Not uncommonly the slender
branches are laden with clusters of a small species of Helix that
at some distance might be taken for fruit.</p>

<p>Without halting, except at one spot to secure some specimens of
the great onion (<i>Allium nigrum</i> of Linnæus), we rode pretty
fast through the belt of cultivated land that lies between the
shore and the hills. The agriculture of this country has probably
undergone little change since the earliest historic period. The
plough in daily use is the same that is figured on the monuments of
ancient Egypt, and with two exceptions the crops are the same—
barley, wheat, lentils, vetches, flax, and pumpkins. America has
supplied two valuable articles of food—maize and potatoes—and two
exotic plants that have become so common as to modify the
appearance of many localities—the <i>Agave</i>, or American aloe
of British greenhouses, and the Indian fig (<i>Opuntia
vulgaris</i>)—both extensively used for hedges, and multiplying
freely on waste ground. The last-named plant contributes to the
scanty dietary of the natives; but the fruit, when eaten in any
quantity, is said to be indigestible, and a potent ally to diarrhœa
and dysentery. On reaching the hills, of which we merely crossed
some low spurs, the aspect of the vegetation<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_28">[28]</span> became more varied. The dominant plants
were still those we had seen in similar situations about Tangier—
the palmetto (<i>Chamærops humilis</i>), the great branched
asphodel (<i>Asphodelus cerasiferus</i>), and some spiny species of
the Cytisus tribe; but the slopes were covered with a brilliant and
varied vegetation, presenting a marked contrast to the comparative
monotony of the tillage region. Most of the common orchids were
seen, and we admired the many climbing plants that cover the
bushes, and even reach the tops of tall trees. The beautiful
<i>Clematis cirrhosa</i> is, indeed, less common here than it is in
Algeria; but the two forms of <i>Smilax</i>, the spiny and the
smooth-stemmed (<i>S. aspera</i> and <i>S. mauritanica</i>), were
abundant; and a wild vine is common here, as it is in similar
positions on the northern skirts of the Great Atlas, where it is
not known to have ever been cultivated for the production of wine.
Our chief botanical prize in this part of the day’s ride was a
beautiful Cytisus, with silvery white leaves and numerous dense
heads of bright yellow flowers (<i>Genista clavata</i> of
Poiret).</p>

<p>Throughout all this part of Marocco we were struck by the
abundance of a dwarf plant of the artichoke tribe (<i>Cynara
humilis</i>), which plays an important part in the domestic economy
of the natives. It is almost stemless, and produces (at a later
season) a large blue head of flower from the midst of a great tuft
of much divided and very spiny leaves. Though not cultivated, it
grows in great abundance in waste spots and the margins of fields
on clay soil. Great piles of it were exposed for sale about the
land gate of Tangier; and every morning whole processions of men,
women, children, and donkeys, all laden with the same substance,
were to be seen taking the same direction. It was painful to watch
the women, half veiled, but not so as to disguise their age and
ugliness, staggering onward, with huge bare legs and feet, under
balloon-like loads of this spiny burden, tied up in a large coarse
cloth. At this season the foliage serves as fodder for
animals;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> somewhat
later, when the heads are approaching the flowering state, they are
extensively consumed as food for the human population, the end of
the stem and the receptacle being eaten raw, as artichokes are in
many parts of Southern Europe.</p>

<p>Though, to judge from the extent of tillage, the population
cannot be very small in this part of the country, we saw but few
habitations, and those of the most miserable description—chiefly
low mud hovels in small groups, seemingly built with a view to
avoid observation in out-of-the-way spots, and never near to the
main track. In this region the natives are of mixed race, partly
Moors and partly of Bereber stock, descendants of Riff people, who
have come down from their mountains to settle in the low
country.</p>

<p>We made our mid-day halt in a rich green level tract that lies
between the first and lower hills, and a second and more
considerable range which connects the Angera Mountains on the north
with the higher mass of the Riff Mountains south of Tetuan. The
drainage of this broad valley seems to flow southward till it falls
into a considerable stream, descending from the high peaks of Beni
Hassan and its neighbouring summits, that reaches the sea on the
west coast some eighteen miles south of Cape Spartel. Our eyes were
here gratified by the sight of comparatively fine trees, everywhere
so scarce in Marocco. Of these the most conspicuous is a southern
species of ash, very like the common tree. It is the <i>Fraxinus
oxyphylla</i> of Bieberstein, which extends from Southern Russia
and the Levant to Spain and Marocco. The leaves and fruit are
smaller, but in this district the tree rivals in stature our native
British species. Poplars are common beside the streams, which are
fringed by tall oleanders and willows, and in drier spots the fig,
carob, and olive grow to a large size. The almond tree is also
common, but does not appear to have naturalised itself.</p>

<p>Animal life does not seem to be abundant; but some<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> of the birds were new enough to
our eyes to diversify the way; The commonest is the stork, which
appears, from a sense of entire security, to have assumed a tone of
complete intimacy with his human neighbours. He may be seen about
the houses, familiar with the little brown-faced, black-eyed boys,
or striding majestically through the crops, or wheeling slowly in
wide circles through the air, till he suddenly stops, drops his
long legs that had been stretched out behind him during flight,
and, poising himself on them like an acrobat on loose stilts, comes
to rest. A blue headed bee-eater, apparently the same species that
is extremely common in South Marocco, was also seen during our
ride.</p>

<p>As we began to ascend the main range of hills that still
separated us from Tetuan we overtook a couple of wild-looking
fellows, one carrying a tambourine, the other a cylindrical basket,
who soon showed that they wanted to attract our attention. Our
stately interpreter, riding along with his nose in the air,
purblinded by his blue goggles, took no notice of them till one sat
down and began tom-toming on the tambourine; and Bulbo, ever ready
for amusement, soon enticed us to see the snake charmers. These
have been so often described, that it is enough to make a few notes
on the natural history of the exhibition. The object of the
tom-toming—at first gentle and lastly furious—with which the
performance commences, is clearly to aid the charmer in his
endeavours to addle his brains, and deaden his nervous
susceptibility, so that he may better encounter the pain, which,
though not intense, must be considerable. His own share commenced
by frenzied dancing and bodily contortions, and above all rolling
his head violently from side to side. This accomplished, the basket
was opened, and after a good deal of hustling two magnificent
snakes unwillingly glided out, raised their beautiful heads,
looking as proud as swans, glanced scornfully about, and very
naturally tried to get back. This the charmer prevented, and still
keeping up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> his
abnormal nervous condition by rolling his head and eyes, bullied
one of them into biting his arm, and then his hand between the
thumb and forefinger, and drawing blood. He next vainly tried to
make a snake strike at his forehead, and then prevailed on it to
seize on his nose, and lastly on his protruded tongue, where it
held on, probably attracted by the moisture, for some seconds,
leaving two bleeding wounds on the upper surface of the organ, and
as many on the under. With the snakes still hanging about him, the
hero concluded the performance by laboriously thrusting a skewer
through his cheek, which had no doubt been previously perforated
for the purpose; after this the serpents were allowed to retire
into the basket, which they were nothing loth to do. In these
performances, which have been seen by most travellers in Egypt and
India, there is little doubt that the poison-fangs have been
previously extracted. Whatever may be said of the effect produced
by music on serpents, there is no reason to suppose that it can
modify the poisonous effect of their bite, and the real object in
these cases is to act on the nervous system of the snake charmer
himself. We were glad when the disgusting exhibition was over, and
we left the performers well pleased with a gratuity of about
eighteen pence—quite as much as five shillings would be to a poor
man in England. When once the secret had been learned, many an
English bumpkin could be got to undergo the operation for a pot of
beer.</p>

<p>As we began to ascend the rugged track that winds up the hills
the aspect of the country soon changed. Amidst the brushwood that
covered the slopes, old gnarled trunks of wild olive, carob, and
lentisk stood here and there—survivors of the forests that must
once have covered the country—whose charred stems and maimed
branches told a tale of the way in which man’s reckless greed has
marred the face of nature here, as in so many other parts of the
earth. Our last halt for botanising was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_32">[32]</span> near a spring, where the green turf was
decked with many small orchids—all of them possibly forms of
<i>Ophrys lutea</i>. We were not then acquainted with the careful
observations of the late Mr. Treherne Moggridge, who completely
proved that the differences in the form and colouring of the
corolla which have been supposed to separate several species of the
genus <i>Ophrys</i> are variable, even on the same plant; but our
passing remarks entirely tally with his conclusions. As we
lingered, the sun sank below the horizon; we unwillingly hearkened
to the exhortations of our followers, who seemed to grow uneasy at
the chance of being benighted, and pushed on towards our resting
place.</p>

<p>The weird figures of the stunted and maimed monsters of the
forest drew closer together as we neared the crest of the hill,
and, in the fast growing gloom, assumed at each moment a more wild
and threatening aspect. Bare branches standing against the sky, and
eye-like holes in the black hollow trunks, were transfigured by the
fancy; and to at least one of us the tale of Sintram, and Albert
Dürer’s quaint old woodcut, supplied additional elements to the
mental picture; until, as we emerged from the wood, the note of the
cuckoo, bringing a whole train of home associations, suddenly broke
the spell. We rode onward, and soon stood before El Fondak, the
most stately place of shelter for travellers in the Marocco
Empire.</p>

<p>From without this shows a rather imposing aspect, resembling
that of a hill fort. A strong wall, some eighteen or twenty feet in
height, without window or opening of any kind, except a central
gate, surrounds a large court-yard. We had been warned that the
accommodation within was not good, and we were not long in coming
to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The large quadrangle formed a sort of stable-yard, wherein were
littered camels, horses, mules, and donkeys. The surrounding
enclosure, covered with a flat stone roof, was walled in on two
sides, and on the others formed a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_33">[33]</span> range of open sheds wherein the camel drivers
piled their burdens, or the keeper of the caravanserai sheltered
his cattle. On the other sides a series of doors gave admission to
as many small cellars, or dungeons, with no other opening than the
door for admitting light or air, empty, except for remnants of
dirty straw and rubbish, but apparently tenanted by every
imaginable variety of insect and creeping thing. The keeper of the
caravanserai, a repulsive-looking old man, threw open one of the
doors, and explained that the apartment had been reserved for our
use. No deliberation was necessary on this occasion, for a
unanimous declaration burst from our lips—nothing would induce us
to enter such a filthy den—and we at once announced our intention
to pass the night upon the roof. Our luggage was accordingly
conveyed up through a narrow stone staircase, and we proceeded to
prepare our frugal supper, of which portable soup was the chief
ingredient, and soon afterwards to make our arrangements for the
night.</p>

<p>Our so-called interpreter had become altogether obnoxious to us.
During our mid-day halt he had coolly appropriated the most
comfortable spot in the shade, devoured most of our oranges, and
plainly showed that he had no notion of taking the slightest
trouble about a set of Frankish lunatics, who spent their time in
grubbing up little weeds by the roots, and looking at them through
bits of glass. He relieved us altogether of his presence this
evening; and we felt a certain satisfaction in thinking that his
well-fed carcase would during the night supply wholesome and
abundant food for the legions of hungry insects that tenanted the
ground-floor of our hotel. Old Bulbo, whether because he shared our
preference for the clean and airy quarters on the roof, or because
he wished to display his zeal for our protection, installed himself
with the long gun in the red case at a convenient distance, while
we, after slowly consuming the evening cigar, unrolled our cork
mattresses, and prepared our bivouac. We<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_34">[34]</span> scarcely noticed at first the peculiar
construction of the roof. Round three sides of the building there
was a low parapet wall, but none whatever towards the front, where
the flags sloped slightly outwards, and ended abruptly at the edge
of the outer wall of the building. The stars shone brightly in the
sky, and a pleasant breeze from the east fanned our faces as we lay
down to rest on the front part of the roof, congratulating
ourselves on the excellence of our quarters, when compared to the
misery we had escaped below. Before long the breeze freshened, the
night grew cooler (55° Fahr.), and we were glad to lace the
oilcloth covers of our mattresses so as to keep out the keen air.
Before doing so, Hooker judiciously laid an empty box on the
windward side, and steadied it by placing within it two or three
bottles of wine, and a few other luxuries for our consumption, his
watch, and such other miscellaneous articles as lay at hand. Snugly
ensconced in our coverings, oblivion soon crept over us, and we
slept, it is hard to say how long. A horrid crash, and the fall of
a heavy body between the adjoining sleepers, startled two of them
into sudden consciousness. It was something like what happens in
the saloon of a steamer, when a heavy sea strikes the ship, and,
amidst a smash of broken glass and crockery, one is suddenly roused
from one’s sofa by the unexpected visit of one’s neighbour’s
travelling bag and hat-box. The cause of the phenomenon was the
same, though the position was very different. The wind had risen to
something more than half a gale, and seemed much inclined to sweep
clear away from the stone roof everything that was not firmly fixed
in its place. As we lay tightly laced in our oilcloth covers, like
the chrysalis in its case, it cost some struggling and wriggling to
get ourselves free, and rush to the rescue of our property, which
was careering along the roof before each gust of wind that struck
the building. Several articles had already been carried away over
the edge; but the moon, shining brightly from amidst the light
scudding clouds,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
helped us to recover everything of importance. The watch and
note-book were safe; but the contents of a broken bottle of claret
had somehow run under the cover of Hooker’s mattress, and, placed
as we were, the attempt to rearrange it was something like the
classical difficulty of ‘swopping horses in the middle of a
stream.’ Cautiously creeping about to see what had befallen our
companions, we found the faithful Bulbo (with more practical
meteorological instinct than we had displayed) safely ensconced on
the lee side of the low parapet. The shapeless heap, rolled up in
the multitudinous folds of a white haïk, could not have been
recognised, but for the inevitable long gun in the red case that
lay beside it.</p>

<p>Little sleep was to be expected for the remainder of the night,
and with the first light we began to move. Though the wind was
falling, we could not attempt to avail ourselves of Maw’s cooking
apparatus, and we agreed to postpone breakfast till we should reach
some more sheltered spot. The vegetation here was little advanced,
and we saw but few plants in flower, save a little yellow
Lithospermum (<i>L. apulum</i>), on our way to the top of the pass,
which was covered with low brushwood and shrubs of the same species
that we had seen near Tangier.</p>

<p>We halted in a hollow place near the highest point, where we
strangely omitted to take observations for altitude; and after a
slight repast hurried down the slope in a SSE. direction, towards
the valley of the Tetuan river. We here enjoyed a fine view of the
snow-streaked mass of the Riff Mountains, which we may call, from
their best known peak, the Beni Hassan Group.</p>

<p>The mountain ranges of the Riff—extending for about 180 miles
from Tetuan to the mouth of the Oued Moulouya, which lies very near
the French frontier—undoubtedly form a part of the system of the
Lesser Atlas of Algeria; but, if we may trust the maps and such
scanty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> reports as can
be picked up, they constitute a separate group, not continuous with
the coast range of Western Algeria. The true relations between the
main range of the Lesser Atlas of Algeria and the diverging ranges
of the Great Atlas that extend over the region S. and SE. of Fez
must remain unknown so long as the latter region remains
inaccessible to European travellers. The river Moulouya and its
eastern branch, the Oued Za, mark the existence of two considerable
valleys, and it is probable that the very sinuous course laid down
for both those streams in the French map may be founded on native
reports approximately correct; while it is quite certain that the
adjoining mountain ranges as shown on that map differ very widely
from the truth. A traveller going from Fez to the mouth of the Oued
Moulouya, in a direction slightly north of due east, traverses a
broad valley, with the Riff Mountains on his left, lying between
him and the Mediterranean coast, and the northern branches of the
Great Atlas on his right. Somewhere near Theza he reaches the
watershed between the region that is drained towards the Atlantic
through the Oued Sebou and the basin of the Oued Moulouya, but
seemingly without having to make any considerable ascent. He
descends to the Moulouya—or rather he would do so if the powerful
Halaf tribe, who hold that region, allowed strangers to pass—where
that river, after cutting its way through the unknown region
between the Great and Lesser Atlas, enters a wide plain, some forty
or fifty miles in extent each way. Before reaching the sea, the
valley is again narrowed. On one side is the eastern extremity of
the Riff Mountains, and on the other a range of lofty hills that
may be considered as spurs of the Lesser Atlas of Algeria.</p>

<p>Before quitting this dry subject, it is necessary to remark
that, even as regards the relatively well-known district near
Tangier and Tetuan, the best maps are far from complete accuracy.
In the French War Office Map—undoubtedly the best map of
Marocco—the hill shading<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_37">[37]</span> gives far too much importance to the
comparatively low hills running from WSW. to ENE. on the south side
of Tangier, and not enough to the range which we crossed between El
Fondak and Tetuan. This extends from the main mass of the Beni
Hassan to Ape’s Hill opposite Gibraltar, and divides the waters
running to the Atlantic from those of the Tetuan river. Over
against this (which we had just crossed) rose a parallel and more
lofty range, terminating in the bold craggy mass of the Beni Hosmar
(B. Aouzmar of the French map), rising steeply from the valley
opposite Tetuan, and to ascend this was the main object of our
present excursion.</p>

<p>Soon after we entered the main valley, and were riding along a
broad track parallel to the Tetuan river, we came upon a group that
for the first time brought home to us an illustration of the true
condition of society in this country. A body of armed horsemen,
many of them true Negroes or mulattoes, were resting beside the
way, broken up into lively groups, laughing and chattering
together. Amongst them was a solitary man, poorly clothed, and, as
we observed, laden with heavy chains. He kept his back turned
towards the track, and seemed to take advantage of the halt to dip
his feet into the brook that ran along beside it. So numerous an
escort in charge of a single prisoner suggested something unusual,
and we were led to make inquiry. According to the story retailed to
us, the chained captive was lately the powerful governor of a
distant province, who had offered a stout resistance when summoned
to the capital to give an account of his administration. It is well
understood in Marocco that such summons, whether framed as a
peremptory order or a flattering invitation, has but one
meaning—that the time has come when it seems to the Sultan or his
counsellors that the wretched governor should be ‘squeezed,’ or, in
other words, be forced by torture to surrender whatever wealth he
may have hoarded. As the appointment of a new governor generally
means that the province will be<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_38">[38]</span> subjected to fresh impositions and
extortions, the people are apt to side with the old governor, and
sometimes, in a country where the central power is so feeble, a
man, by a judicious combination of force and bribery, may long keep
the government at bay, and escape the miserable fate that usually
awaits him. Our prisoner, apparently, was too formidable a man to
be safely kept at Fez or Marocco, and was therefore sent to Tetuan,
the extreme limit of the territory, there to undergo such torture
as might be necessary to extort confession of the hiding place of
his treasure, unless, through ill-judged obstinacy, he should die
in torments before disgorging as much as might be expected. No
better illustration of the system can be found than the fact that
strangers are informed, as of something extraordinary and
unexampled, that one old man now lives at Tetuan who long held a
high and confidential post in the government, and yet was allowed
to retire without being ‘squeezed!’ The truth is, that he had
gained the good-will and confidence of the representatives of the
European Powers, and that it was urged upon the late Sultan that
the credit of his government would suffer, if, after a long course
of faithful service, the minister were to undergo the common fate
of his colleagues.</p>

<p>Some twenty years before, when one of our party visited Tetuan,
the whole province was thrown into confusion by one of these
customary acts of the then reigning Sultan. Hash Hash, a man of
unusual capacity and energy, had governed the province of Tetuan
for many years with extraordinary success. He kept the turbulent
Riff mountaineers in order, and, so it was said, Jew and Christian,
under his rule, enjoyed the same security as the Moor. At length he
received messengers from the Court with the gift of a white horse
richly caparisoned, and an autograph letter from his sovereign full
of commendation and winding up with an invitation to the capital,
then fixed at Fez. He started on the fatal journey, but arrived
only to be flung<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> into
a dungeon and subjected to daily torture. Soldiers were sent to
Tetuan, where his house was pillaged, his wives and children led to
prison, while the absence of all control led to a rapid growth of
crime in the district, and life and property were no longer thought
safe in the surrounding country.</p>

<p>TETUAN</p>

<p><a href="images/i03_large.jpg">(<i>Large-size</i>)</a>
</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The approach to Tetuan presented the most picturesque scene that
we anywhere beheld in Marocco. Begirt with a lofty wall, set at
short intervals with massive square towers, the city shows from a
distance only a few mosques and a heavy, frowning heap of masonry
that forms the castle or citadel. It stands on the slope of a
limestone hill, some two hundred feet above the river, which flows
through a broad valley, rich with the most brilliant vegetation.
After riding for hours over the thirsty hills, it was a delight to
rest the eyes on the patches of emerald meadow, and on the darker
green of the luxuriant orchards, where the best oranges in the
world grow along with figs, almonds, peaches, and all our common
tree fruit. Amidst all this wealth of greenery many a little white
house—a mere cube of chalk—gleamed brightly. Most of these seem to
belong to peasant owners, but some are kiosks to which the
wealthier inhabitants repair to escape from the heat and bad air of
the town.</p>

<p>We were not yet familiar with the squalor and neglect that seem
the inevitable characteristics of a Moorish town, and it was a
disappointment to find the interior of Tetuan correspond so ill to
the picturesqueness of its outward aspect. After riding between
high walls, apparently forming an inner defence to the town, we
went through some streets of mean aspect, and, traversing one wide
open space, passed under an interior gate guarded by a sentry, and
found ourselves in a labyrinth of narrow alleys decidedly cleaner
than the remainder of the city. This is the Jewish quarter, where,
as in the Jewry or <i>Ghetto</i> of mediæval Europe, the children
of Israel are required to live apart, within a wall and gates that
are locked at night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
and where they seem to manage their own affairs with little
interference from the Moorish authorities. We soon established
ourselves in very fair quarters at the house of Isaac Nahum, who
acts as clerk and interpreter at the single consulate which of late
years has watched over the safety of all Europeans who happen to
reach Tetuan whether by land or sea. Since the war in which Tetuan
was taken by the Spanish troops—their solitary achievement during
the last sixty years—the Government of Spain has desired to
maintain its influence in this part of the country by the presence
of a consul; and the other European States have willingly taken
advantage of his presence. The duties cannot be heavy, for few
strangers now visit Tetuan, although up to the year 1770 it was the
residence of all the European consuls. The beauty of its site, the
excellence of its oranges and other fruit, and the reported
superiority in refinement of its inhabitants, both Moorish and Jew,
do not compensate for the difficulty of access by sea, since none
but the smallest class of coasting vessels can cross the bar at the
mouth of the river. This is guarded (or was so up to the time of
the Spanish war in 1859) by a massive square tower, without door or
other apparent opening. A Christian boat from Gibraltar, in which
one of us had formerly arrived, was hailed from the summit of the
tower. After a preliminary parley, a rope ladder was let down from
the top, some seventy or eighty feet, and a black soldier scrambled
down with great activity, the final result of the parley being that
the strangers, after payment of some trifling harbour dues, were
sent to the town, a distance of five or six miles, under the escort
of a soldier.</p>

<p>Whether because there really is some slight diminution in the
feeling that has so long excluded strangers, and especially
Christians, from the interior of Marocco, or that previous
travellers had happened to make the attempt at unfavourable
conjunctures, we found that the letter to the Governor given to us
by Sir J. D. Hay was scarcely required,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_41">[41]</span> and no difficulty was raised about the
requisite official permission to ascend the Beni Hosmar, as the
mountain mass is called, which forms the end of the chain extending
northward from the Beni Hassan.</p>

<p>One of our party had already succeeded in ascending about half
the height of the mountain; but the only European known to have
reached the upper ridge was the late Mr. Barker Webb, the author of
the ‘Phytographia Canariensis,’ and other important botanical
works. He effected his object by liberal expenditure, having begun
by a present of 40<em>l</em>. to the Governor, besides handsome
rewards to those who were sent with him.</p>

<p>We had no occasion to follow this example. The protection of the
British Government, and the interest shown in our journey by the
British Minister, were quite sufficient arguments on our behalf,
and with the courteous assistance of the Spanish consul the
arrangements for our excursion were soon settled. The requisite
orders were issued by the Kaïd, and two soldiers were appointed,
along with our Tangier men, to escort us on the following
morning.</p>

<p>In spite of the usual delays, we started in good time on the
morning of the 11th, and, descending over successive ledges of
tufa, forming terraces for gardens and orchards, soon reached the
level of the river, which was easily forded. The air was cool (55°
Fahr. at 6 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>), the sky bright, and the
hedges gay with the evergreen rose (<i>R. sempervirens</i>), and
the large-flowered form of the hedge convolvulus (<i>C.
sylvatica</i>), which in the South replaces our more modest
Northern form, <i>C. sepium</i> of Linnæus. A short ascent among
trees and high hedges took us clear of the cultivated land, and the
aspect of the country at once changed. The upper part of the
mountain is disposed in tiers of limestone crags, irregularly
disposed, and therefore offering no difficulty for the ascent; but
round the base are rather steep and very arid slopes, formed, in
great part, of old accumulations of débris fallen from the upper
crags. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> most
conspicuous shrubs are lentisk, oak scrub, <i>Juniperus
phœnicea</i>, and several <i>Cisti</i>; but the palmetto
successfully contends against its rivals, and in some places quite
covers the soil. It disappears, however, before one reaches the
middle height of the mountain, and the limit of its free growth,
not taking account of a few scattered and stunted specimens, was
found to be 1,227 feet (374 mètres) above the sea. The prevailing
species, however, were small shrubby <i>Leguminosæ</i>. Of these
the most trying to the temper of the botanist is <i>Calycotome
villosa</i>. This and the allied species (<i>C. spinosa</i>) are
very common in the warmer parts of the Mediterranean region, and
the stiff spiny points of the numerous branches are most effective
in tearing the clothing and the skin of anyone who approaches
them.</p>

<p>We followed a tolerably good cattle track which wound upwards to
the right, in a southerly direction, towards the upper part of the
mountain. Before reaching its middle height, on some crags facing
towards Tetuan, we found a peculiar saxifrage (<i>S. Maweana</i>),
first collected by Mr. Webb more than forty years before, but
which, with several others, remained unknown and undescribed in his
Herbarium. Maw refound the plant in 1869, and has successfully
cultivated it, along with many other Marocco rarities, in his
garden in Shropshire. On the same rocks, besides numerous
interesting plants not yet in flower, we gathered a curious
crucifer (<i>Succowia balearica</i>) which must flower very early
as the fruit was already approaching maturity.</p>

<p>As we really desired nothing more than to be let to wander about
on the mountain according to our own fancy, we were rather pleased
than otherwise when our escort of four soldiers with the guide,
seeming to think that they had done enough of mountaineering after
an ascent of some two thousand feet, proceeded to instal
themselves, with the horses, who enjoyed a day of rest, in a
pleasant spot, and showed no sign of pushing the enterprise
farther.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> A steep
slope now led us up to the rocky ridge of the mountain commanding a
wide view, and overlooking a deep glen on the seaward side of the
mountain. Here, in spite of the early season, we found several
plants in flower that excited in us a lively interest. A little
polygala, with rich purple red flowers, reminds one much of the red
variety of <i>P. chamæbuxus</i> that is often seen in the Eastern
Alps, but appears to be quite distinct. A chrysanthemum, differing
little from an Algerian species, was our first acquaintance amongst
a group of forms that is especially characteristic of the flora of
the Great Atlas. But we were, perhaps, still more pleased to find
on these heights, far removed from the nearest known station, some
descendants of a suffering race that must, at some remote period,
have been widely spread throughout Europe, the bright-flowered
<i>Ranunculus gramineus</i>. Although it is still found at several
places in France, in a few spots in the Alps, and in Spain, it
appears to have disappeared from the Apennines within the last two
centuries, and to be everywhere losing ground. When the rapacity of
collectors shall have reduced it elsewhere to the condition of a
vegetable Dodo, future travellers may rejoice that it has found a
refuge in this corner of Africa. The distribution of the genus
<i>Ranunculus</i>, in nearly every known country, supplies many
topics for thought and inquiry. There are very few regions where
the unbotanical traveller fails to recognise the familiar buttercup
of his youth; yet, if he examines the plants, he will find
well-marked differences in the leaves, the fruit, the stem, or the
root, though the flowers may be scarcely distinguishable. Since our
first landing in Marocco, buttercups had met us in all directions;
but they nearly all belonged to one variable species, <i>R.
chærophyllos</i>, widely spread round the warmer shores of the
Mediterranean. In shady places we had a few times gathered another
North African species, <i>R. macrophyllus</i>, and on this mountain
we found a few specimens, already past flower, of <i>R.
spicatus</i>; but of all the common<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_44">[44]</span> species of Britain and Middle Europe, not one
had been seen, unless we count the ubiquitous white-flowered
species of our ditches, <i>R. aquatilis</i>.</p>

<p>From the time we first got a clear view of our mountain we had
fixed on a range of beetling crags, not far below the summit, which
promised to afford an excellent habitat for rare plants. The
promise was kept, for we had scarcely approached their base when
with joyful cries we saluted one of the chief prizes of our
excursion. From clefts on the face of the rock hung great leafy
tufts, quite a yard in diameter, supported on stems as thick as a
man’s arm. The flowering branches produced an abundance of yellow
flowers, then just expanding and only partly opened. We should have
set it down as a new and very luxuriant species of wild cabbage,
but that we happened to know that the fruit is entirely different,
so much so as to constitute a very distinct genus of
<i>Cruciferæ</i>. Mr. Webb, who probably gathered the plant at this
very spot, described and figured it, in the ‘Annales des Sciences
Naturelles,’ under the name <i>Hemicrambe fruticulosa</i>; but the
original specimen seems to have been lost or mislaid, and no one
had since laid eyes upon the living plant. The same rocks produced
abundantly the beautiful <i>Iberis gibraltarica</i>, besides many
fine plants not yet in flower, amongst which we recognised the rare
Spanish centaurea, <i>C. Clementei</i>.</p>

<p>As seen from Tetuan, the ridge above the rocks appeared to lead
very directly to the not distant summit of the mountain; but when,
after a short scramble, we had set foot upon it, we clearly saw our
mistake. At about a mile and a half from where we stood, and
separated from us by a rather profound depression, was another
ridge, some three or four hundred feet higher, which might or might
not be surpassed by more distant prominences in the same range. It
would have been easy to reach the farther summits, but we thought
our time better spent in carefully examining the part of the
mountain within our reach.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_45">[45]</span> Various indications, such as the
disappearance of several species that are abundant lower down, and
the much more backward state of the vegetation, went to prove that
the climate of the upper plateau is sensibly different from that of
its middle region; but there was little to show that we had reached
the limit of a true mountain, much less that of a subalpine flora.
We had, indeed, already found a variety of the large-flowered
<i>Senecio Doronicum</i>, which in the Alps and Pyrenees ascends
even to the Alpine region; and near our highest point Ball found a
form of <i>Erodium petræum</i>, which in the Pyrenees and Northern
Spain usually attains the subalpine zone. The season was still too
little advanced; and the naturalist who will follow our footsteps
about the beginning of June may expect a much richer harvest.</p>

<p>Having taken observations for altitude, which give height of
about 3,040 feet above the sea for our station, we halted a few
minutes to enjoy the noble panorama that was spread out below us.
On the western side successive undulations of the ground—range
beyond range of low hills—melted away into the horizon, but as the
eye turned northward it rested on a more varied picture. To the
right of the Angera Mountains and Ape’s Hill a small dark islet
seemed to stand out from the Spanish coast. In this we scarcely
recognised Gibraltar, for the shadow of a cloud happened to rest on
its grey limestone cliffs. To the right extended a long reach of
coast line, foreshortened from the promontory of Ceuta to the mouth
of the river below Tetuan, with the much more distant outline of
the Serrania de Ronda in the background. Then as we turned
eastward, though the view was partly interrupted by projecting
spurs of the mountain, we followed the long outline of the coast
range of North Marocco, the secure refuge of the unconquered Riff
tribes, whose fastnesses have never been profaned by the presence
of an alien master. Some patches of dark shade evidently indicated
forests, and these may probably consist wholly or<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span> in part of the Atlantic cedar,
although that tree is not positively known to grow in
Marocco.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>In order to cover as much ground as possible during the descent,
we here agreed to take different directions, and lost sight of each
other for some time. Hooker came upon a small mountain village, or
hamlet, where several Bereber or Riffian families were crowded
together in hovels built of mud mixed with stone, and rather better
fitted to resist the weather than the sheds we had seen in the
plain. Conversation was not practicable, but there was no
indication of ill will on the part of these people. The only
attempt at intercourse was on the part of one sturdy man who
apparently requested a pinch of snuff, but declined the offer of a
cigar. The use of tobacco for smoking appears to be unknown in
Marocco, while <i>kief</i>—prepared from the chopped leaves of
common hemp—is almost universally employed for that purpose both by
Moors and Berebers; but snuff is in general request, and is
imported in considerable quantities, both by regular traders and by
smugglers who profit largely by the heavy duty.</p>

<p>In descending the mountain we observed large patches<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> of a species of furze, smaller
and stiffer in habit than our common gorse—the <i>Ulex bæticus</i>
of Boissier—one of a group of nearly allied forms that replace our
British species in the south of Spain and Portugal, and the
neighbouring shores of Marocco.</p>

<p>On rejoining our so-called escort, we agreed that the track was
too steep to make riding pleasant; and thus we all descended on
foot till near the foot of the mountain, when a proper care for
their dignity compelled the soldiers and the guide to remount.</p>

<p>We returned to our quarters in the town before the sun had set,
and closed a very enjoyable day by reviewing our botanical prizes
as we laid them into paper to undergo the first step in the process
of their preservation. As usual the evening cigar accompanied our
discussion as to future proceedings, and to its soothing influence
we doubtless owe the fact that these debates always led to a
satisfactory conclusion. On this occasion we agreed to divide our
small party into two sections and separate for a few days. Maw was
anxious to return at once to Tangier, with a view to visit some
swamps that lie about ten miles south-west of the town, while
Hooker and Ball were desirous of examining the coast between Tetuan
and Ceuta. As it appeared that a small stock of Spanish would serve
all necessary purposes in the excursion to Ceuta, Maw volunteered
to take our disagreeable interpreter and one unnecessary soldier
back to Tangier, while Bulbo was willing to risk a visit to the
infidels at Ceuta.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 12th Maw departed, but Hooker was unwell.
It was decided that a quiet day and the judicious exhibition of
moderate doses of cognac, which we owed to the kindness of the
Spanish consul, would be the most appropriate treatment; and the
result was quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>Ball spent the day in botanising over the hills near the town,
and was well satisfied with the result. The rarest plant found was,
perhaps, a curious and very distinct<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_48">[48]</span> fumitory (<i>Fumaria africana</i> of
Lamarck), which he had gathered nearly at the same spot twenty
years before. The red-flowered Polygala of Beni Hosmar (<i>P.
Webbiana</i> of Cosson) was seen in a few spots near the town along
with <i>Arabis pubescens</i>; and that singular plant, the
<i>Drosophyllum</i>, hitherto seen in Marocco only on the hills
west of Tangier, was here found within sight of the Mediterranean,
growing along with <i>Helianthemum umbellatum</i> and several other
less rare species of the Cistus tribe.</p>

<p>During our stay here we had a good opportunity of seeing
something of the life of the Marocco Jews, who form a distinct and
important element in the population of the empire. Tetuan has long
been one of the head-quarters of the Hebrew race. When most of the
chief Moorish families took refuge here after their expulsion from
Spain—and some are said still to preserve the keys of their own
houses in Granada—many Jews, flying from the faggots of the
Inquisition, preferred the comparative toleration of Moslem rule,
to the oppression and social disabilities that awaited them in
Christian Europe. It was more tolerable to submit to occasional
injustice and cruelty which was shared by all classes of society
around them than to be daily reminded that they formed a class
apart—the proper objects of general contempt and aversion. It is
true that until late years the Marocco Jew was exposed to some
vexatious regulations. He was required to put off his sandals on
passing the outside of a mosque, to wear a peculiar dress, and is
still confined to a separate quarter in each town. But in ordinary
intercourse between man and man the Jews of the coast towns seemed
to us to have attained a footing of almost complete equality, due
as well to their superior intelligence and commercial instinct, as
to the tolerance which affinity of race and creed has developed
among the people of Arab stock. In truth, the Moor feels that the
Jew is indispensable to him. In despite of his aversion to
intercourse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> with the
Christian, trade, in which the Jew serves as intermediary, has
become a practical necessity, and it has procured for him foreign
luxuries which he is now little inclined to forego.</p>

<p>In point of fact, Tetuan boasts of being the cradle of more
wealthy Jewish families than any other town in the world; and among
the practical concessions enjoyed by them, there now appears to be
no difficulty in the way of Jews leaving the empire and returning
to it, and frequent intercourse is carried on between the city and
Europe by the way of Ceuta. The ceremonial observances of the
Mosaic law are strictly adhered to. The first question put to us on
our arrival was to know whether we had with us leavened bread, as
such could not be admitted to the house during the feast of the
Passover; and during our stay we were given cakes, some of plain
flour, others prepared with orange juice.</p>

<p>The houses are quite on the same plan as those of the Moors, or
in other words they merely differ in architectural detail from the
ancient type that is preserved for us in the smaller houses of
Pompeii. A single court (atrium) has several small rooms or closets
used for kitchen, offices, and sleeping place for servants, and one
large apartment, the chief living room of the family, filling one
side. This remains open to the court by day, but is closed at night
by a curtain. On the upper floor a gallery surrounds the court, and
into this open upper rooms of moderate size. In Nahum’s house a
second floor above the first had been added, but this appeared to
be an unusual arrangement. On our arrival we had been struck by the
superior neatness and cleanliness of the Jewish, as compared to the
Moorish, quarter, and the same remark applied to their persons.</p>

<p>No European traders appear to have settled at Tetuan, and such
trade as it possesses is in the hands of the Jews. Oranges, and a
sort of brandy, called Mahaya, distilled from the grape, are the
chief exports. The coarse pottery made here is much the same as
that produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> in
Algeria and throughout Western Marocco. Rude geometrical patterns
in ill-defined blue and green tints are usually enriched by round
spots of bright red, laid on with something like sealing-wax over
the glazing, and easily removed with spirit. The only thing
deserving notice as representing art-manufacture is the gold
embroidery, usually worked on silk or velvet. This is used for
curtains or hangings by some wealthy Moors, and for personal wear
by the Jewish women and children. At this festival season the
younger children frequently appeared with caps or diadems richly
embroidered; but the women more often wear a light silk
handkerchief, with the fringe hanging freely, but kept in its place
by a fillet of black or red velvet worked in gold, and forming a
very ornamental head-dress.</p>

<p>Travellers have indulged in enthusiastic descriptions of the
beauty of the Marocco Jewesses. Those who have visited Tetuan will
have seen a fair specimen in the person of our host’s sister, a
tall comely girl, free from the tendency to corpulence which is too
common, and whose regular features are set off by a pair of fine
dark eyes. But those for whom expression is an essential element of
beauty in the human countenance will usually find something wanting
to complete the attractions of the undeniably handsome women of
this country.</p>

<p>It so happened that the occasion was especially favourable for
seeing something of the life of the Israelite society of the city.
This was the last of the festival days of the Passover, and towards
evening there was a large gathering of neighbours in the
ground-floor apartments of our house. The women were richly dressed
in loose garments of light silk and a profusion of gold embroidery.
It was almost impossible to recognise our host’s mother, a
corpulent woman, who had hitherto appeared in a shabby costume of
the scantiest proportions in which the developments of her ample
person were unpleasantly apparent. Arrayed in festival splendour,
she now assumed a regal attitude, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_51">[51]</span> her figure appeared to be modelled on that of
the nearest Christian potentate, the unregretted Queen Isabella.
The men wore long blue coats of the dressing-gown pattern, with
white cotton stockings and slippers, and, if not picturesque in
appearance, showed to advantage beside our host who, mindful of his
dignity as interpreter to the Consulate, appeared in European black
frock coat and trousers. The children were especially gorgeous in
head-dresses of crimson or purple velvet richly embroidered in
gold. During the evening there was an attempt at dancing to the
music of an accordion; but the space was too limited, and this was
speedily given up. The party continued, however, till a late hour,
and midnight passed before the sound of lively talk and laughter
ceased in the lower chambers of our house.</p>

<p>On the morning of April 13 we started for Ceuta, about thirty
miles distant from Tetuan. The track for several miles lies at some
distance from the coast, which on the north side of the mouth of
the river forms a projecting headland, called by the Spaniards Cabo
Negro. After riding through green lanes, we mounted gradually by a
broad path that winds amidst bushy hills for a couple of hours, and
then descended towards the sandy shore; and for the remainder of
the way kept close to the beach. After fording one or two smaller
streams issuing from the marshy pools that lay between us and the
hills on our left, we had a little trouble in crossing a more
considerable torrent that seems to bring down most of the drainage
of the Angera Mountains lying behind Ape’s Hill. The horses’ feet
sank deeply in the yielding sand of the bed, though we were able to
wade across without difficulty. It was an anxious moment for us as
we watched the baggage mules struggling and floundering, until the
water rose very nearly to the precious packages of paper that
contained the fruits of our work since we left Tangier. Several
villages were seen on the slopes of the hills to our left, but
during the entire day we passed only three or four small
houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>Our day’s ride lay
over the scene of the Spanish campaign in Marocco in the winter of
1859-60—a military event so completely eclipsed by the great wars
that have since desolated many parts of Europe, as to be now almost
forgotten. An intelligent and animated account of it was published
by the late Mr. Hardman, who accompanied the Spanish army as
correspondent of the <em>Times</em> newspaper. The advance of
O’Donnell, the Spanish commander-in-chief, was slow and cautious;
but considering the natural difficulties, and his complete
ignorance of the resources and designs of the enemy, any other
course would have been chargeable with rashness. The Moors,
although at the last they showed the utmost personal intrepidity,
failed to display the slightest military capacity—even such as has
been found among many savage tribes—failing to take advantage of
natural difficulties, and exposing themselves in fruitless and
desultory attacks when the Spanish force occupied strong positions.
The most serious difficulty for the Spanish general arose from the
necessity for moving his army along the narrow strip of shore,
where for several miles the ground between this and the stony hills
of the interior is partly covered by shallow lagoons, and the soft
soil is intersected by streams. An active enemy knowing the ground
might have inflicted heavy loss on the advancing force; but,
contrary to all expectation, the Moors scarcely showed themselves
at the critical moment, and the Spaniards had none but the natural
obstacles to contend with. After crossing the pass over which the
ordinary track runs to Tetuan, the Spaniards marched to the left,
and established themselves in an entrenched camp near the mouth of
the Tetuan river, where they received by sea reinforcements in men,
heavy guns, and provisions. After some delay, a brilliant action,
terminated by the storming of their camp near Tetuan, cowed the
Moorish leaders, and the Spanish occupied the city, but only after
it had been sacked by the irregular forces of the retreating army.
The Moors then sued for<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_53">[53]</span> peace; but whether the negotiations were
merely opened to gain time, or that the terms demanded by Spain,
including the permanent cession of Tetuan, were deemed exorbitant,
hostilities were resumed in March, and the Spanish army commenced
to move towards Tangier. A final effort was made by the Moors; and
in the battle which ensued, on the slopes of the hills by which we
descended a few days ago into the valley of Tetuan, their men,
though fighting against nearly 25,000 regular troops, well provided
with artillery, seemed for a moment likely to win the day by sheer
desperate valour. The victory cost the Spaniards some 1,300 men in
killed and wounded, but achieved the object of the campaign. Guided
by wiser counsels, the Spanish Government ceased to insist on the
permanent occupation of Tetuan, and the city was restored to the
Moors, on the payment of a war indemnity of about
4,000,000<em>l</em>. sterling. In the judgment of impartial foreign
critics, the Spanish troops behaved extremely well throughout this
campaign: when well led they showed no lack of fighting qualities,
and to their patience under hardship, their temperance, and general
good conduct, all observers bore testimony.</p>

<p>One result of the war was to increase the customs’ duties
throughout Marocco, and to cause more strenuous efforts to keep
down contraband trade than had ever been used before. The indemnity
was partly provided by a five per cent. loan, raised in London; and
the customs duties supply the means for paying the interest, with
instalments of the principal. These have been so punctually
discharged, that the stock usually stands at par. On the Atlantic
sea-board the points accessible to sea-going ships are so few that
little smuggling can exist. The long strip of Mediterranean coast
between Tetuan and the French frontier is nearly all held by the
semi-independent tribes of the Riff mountaineers, and it may be
presumed that these pay no duties on the few articles of foreign
produce that they consume; but the southern shore of the
Straits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> of Gibraltar
and the coast between Ceuta and Tetuan are easy of access in fine
weather, and here the Moorish authorities are obliged to maintain a
force of coast-guards. We met several wild-looking fellows, who
became more frequent as we approached the Spanish lines before
Ceuta, each scantily clothed and armed with a long gun. They must
suffer much in cold and rainy weather, as they have no other
protection than a slight screen of branches, interlaced with straw
or reeds.</p>

<p>Ceuta stands upon a narrow promontory that forms the eastern
extremity of a spur projecting from the high range of Ape’s Hill.
As this promontory is only the last in a series of conical summits
that gradually diminish in height as they approach the
Mediterranean, the fortress is completely commanded on the land
side. But the Spaniards have erected small forts on the nearer
heights, and with moderate watchfulness are secure enough from any
assault that could be made by the Moors. As we rode over the neck
of land connecting the fortress with the adjoining hills, and
finally approached the only entrance, which is reached by a
succession of gates and drawbridges, we had leisure to admire the
elaborate character of the defences, in which every known resource
of military engineering, as understood at the beginning of the last
century, seems to have been accumulated. The soul of Uncle Toby
would have delighted in the multiplication of ditches, curtains,
ravelins, demi-lunes, hornworks, and palisades that have been
expended here for the purpose of astonishing the untutored mind of
the ignorant Moor.</p>

<p>The little town that forms the kernel of these vast
fortifications far surpassed our expectations. Say what we will,
there is a vast gap between the condition of the least advanced
countries of Europe and the barbarism from which no Mohammedan
State has yet contrived to raise itself. Ceuta, however, is a very
favourable sample of a Spanish town, and is far superior in aspect
to most places of equal importance in the mother-country. The
well-built<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> houses in
the main street, all dazzling with fresh whitewash, were gay with
bright flowers that stood in pots and boxes on the balconies behind
ironwork of elaborately ornate character, and the inhabitants had
an air of activity and animation not common in Spain, anywhere out
of Catalonia. We drew our bridles at the Fonda Italiana, the best
looking of several inns, where we learned that all the bedrooms
were occupied, and were sent for sleeping quarters to a
neighbouring house. We got a large room with two good beds, and
found everything both there and at the inn, where we were well fed,
scrupulously clean. Our remark, which probably would not have been
approved in Downing Street, was, ‘What a pity, when they were about
it, that the Spaniards did not annex the whole of North Marocco!’
The course of events in Spain during the last six or eight years
has gone far to justify Downing Street, and to show that European
anarchy may be even worse than Moorish misgovernment.</p>

<p>As, in accordance with our daily custom, we reviewed the produce
of our day’s botanising, before committing our plants to paper, it
seemed to fall rather short of our expectations. The season was not
yet advanced enough for many seaside species, and, besides, as
every naturalist knows, one’s power of observation on horseback is
comparatively limited. When the eye is carried forward by an
external agency, and its motion is not altogether regulated by the
will, many minute objects are too imperfectly seen to convey a
definite image; and however often one may dismount, many slight
suggestions that would be tested by one on foot are allowed to pass
without verification. Along with most of the shrubs that we had
seen about Tangier, we passed many small trees of <i>Tamarix
africana</i> and stout bushes of <i>Juniperus phœnicea</i>. The
most ornamental plant that we gathered was <i>Phaca bætica</i>,
with fine purplish blue flowers, very unlike any of the forms of
the same genus with which we were familiar in the Alps. The most
interesting plant, in a scientific<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_56">[56]</span> sense, that we found this day was so minute
as to be altogether overlooked at the time; and it was only some
time after our return to England that two minute specimens (less
than an inch in height) were found engaged in a tuft of some
stouter plant. They belong to a little crucifer, called
<i>Malcolmia nana</i>. It has been found in a few spots scattered
at wide intervals throughout the Mediterranean region, and as far
eastward as the shores of the Caspian Sea.</p>

<p>At Ceuta we had the spectacle—always a painful one—of gangs of
convicts chained together, and working under the charge of
soldiers, which meets the eye in so many parts of Southern Europe.
Difficult as is the subject of penal discipline for criminals, it
may safely be said that this is one of the worst—if not the very
worst—system that has ever been devised. The punishment, however
hard, loses through familiarity most of its deterrent effect;
while, far from reforming, it seems to be the most efficient method
known for finally corrupting the less hardened offender. The
objections are somewhat lessened when the convict station is
removed from the general gaze, and where the prisoners have little
hope and even little temptation to escape.</p>

<p>These conditions are satisfied in the three fortified posts
which, besides Ceuta, the Spaniards hold on the coast of Marocco.
The most considerable of these is Melilla, on a promontory a few
miles south of Cape Tres Forcas, said to be a strong fort, but
grievously damaged by an earthquake in 1848. It must be little
better than a prison for the garrison as well as for the convicts,
if it be true, as we were told, that it is considered unsafe to
venture beyond musket-shot from the walls, and the Riff
mountaineers amuse themselves from time to time by taking pot-shots
at the sentries on the ramparts. The other posts are on rocky
islets near the shore. El Peñon de Velez, also called Velez de
Gomera, is about half-way between Ceuta and Melilla, and only about
eight miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> from the
site of the Carthaginian city of Bedis—Belis of the Arabs—whence
some etymologists derive the Spanish Velez. From the rank of an
episcopal city in early Christian times, Bedis fell into bad repute
as a pirate port, until it was taken and destroyed by the
Spaniards. The third Spanish post is on the larger of the Zaffarine
Islands, that rise from the Mediterranean nearly opposite the mouth
of the Oued Moulouya, not far from the French frontier. To judge
from a small packet of plants collected there by Mr. Webb, the only
scientific traveller known to have visited them, these are mere
barren rocks, affording no shelter to any but the common seaside
species.</p>

<p>Of late years the Riff people have kept to their mountain
fastnesses, and piracy is no longer an habitual occupation; but it
would not be safe to suppose that it has been completely
extinguished. The coast has many inlets and creeks that shelter
fishing boats, which may easily be used for cutting out unarmed
merchantmen when becalmed near the coast. As late as 1855 two or
three cases of that nature were reported to the home authorities by
the Governor of Gibraltar: and as pursuit was out of the question,
and the Moorish Government owns no control over the Riff
population, no redress was obtainable. The increasing use of steam
has probably made the occupation tedious and unprofitable.</p>

expedition to Marocco are preserved as a separate collection.
Amongst these are some fragments of the Atlantic cedar, which would
appear from the accompanying label to have been obtained by him at
Tetuan from some native of the Riff Mountains. It is probable that
the same tree may be widely spread throughout the unexplored
mountain districts of North-eastern Marocco. Gerhard Rohlfs, the
only European who is known to have traversed the high mountain
region S. of Fez, describing the fine valleys inhabited by the
powerful tribe of the Beni M’ghill, says that the prevailing trees
were larches of greater dimensions than he had ever seen elsewhere.
He declares that he measured several stems from three to four
metres in girth, and that such were not uncommon. It is in the
highest degree improbable that the larch, which in Europe finds its
southern limit in the Pyrenees, should extend to Marocco; and, as
Mr. Rohlfs has no knowledge of botany, it is most likely that the
tree which called forth his admiration is the Atlantic cedar.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">With</span> the previous
permission of the Commandant, we sailed from Ceuta in the
Government felucca on the morning of the 15th, and had a pleasant
run before a south-west breeze, which took us before noon to
Algeciras. Our intention had been to return the same day to
Tangier, but we found that the ordinary steamer had been taken up
to carry sight-seers to a bull-fight at Seville. Resigning
ourselves to the delay, we found fair accommodation in an inn upon
the quay, and started for a walk over the wooded hills behind the
town, not sorry to have an opportunity of comparing the vegetation
of the opposite shores at this point where Europe and Africa so
nearly meet.</p>

<p>The general aspect of the floras is nearly identical, but there
is enough of difference to show that for a long period a barrier
has existed sufficient to limit the diffusion of many
characteristic species. Of these we found three on the hill near
Algeciras—<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>, <i>Sibthorpia europæa</i>,
and <i>Helianthemum lasianthum</i>, a fine species with large
yellow flowers, approaching a Cistus in stature and habit. A much
longer list of European plants that have not passed into Africa
might be made if all the known species found between Gibraltar and
Trafalgar were taken into account; but it might with some reason be
objected, that our knowledge of the African side<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span> of the Strait is too incomplete
to speak confidently on this point. On the other hand, however, we
may with some certainty assert that comparatively many well-marked
species found on the southern side of the Strait are limited to the
African shore, and have not been able to spread into Europe. From
the accessible materials we find at least thirty-eight species
belonging to this category, of which the large majority are species
spread over a wide area in Northern Africa.</p>

<p>In attempting to draw inferences from these facts, it is
necessary to bear in mind that the region where they occur—the
southern part of the Iberian peninsula, and the opposite corner of
Marocco—is remarkable for the variety of its flora, and for the
large number of distinct species, each inhabiting a very restricted
area. To those who suppose that the presence of numerous plants in
two neighbouring districts, which are limited to one or the other,
but are not common to both, is to be regarded as evidence for the
existence of a physical barrier between them, an objector might
reply that we have no more right to affirm that it is the prolonged
existence of the Strait between Europe and Africa that has
prevented the extension of so many species from one continent to
the other, than we have to maintain that two neighbouring mountain
groups, such as the Sierra Nevada of Granada and the Serrania de
Ronda, each possessing a number of peculiar species, must have been
formerly isolated by the sea, as otherwise the species would have
been intermixed.</p>

<p>In answer to this objection, it may, with some plausibility, be
urged that a large majority of the species with restricted areas
are mountain plants; that there is much reason to believe that most
of these peculiar species did originate within insulated areas, at
a time when these were separated by the sea from neighbouring
masses, where the conditions of life for each organism must have
been somewhat different; and that in a few instances local
peculiarities of soil, either chemical or mechanical,
may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> explain the fact
that a particular species is limited to a very small district.
These considerations do not, however, fully explain the known facts
regarding some regions of the earth possessing an exceptional
number of peculiar species confined to small areas, the most
remarkable of which are Asia Minor, South Africa, South-western
Australia, and that which we are now discussing; and in weighing
the evidence afforded by the floras of the opposite coasts as
bearing on the probable duration of such a barrier as the Strait of
Gibraltar, it is best to leave out of account all species that are
not known to be widely distributed. Here our very limited knowledge
of the flora of North Marocco opposes a considerable difficulty.
Subject to such light as future observation will throw upon the
subject, it may be said that, so far as mere botanical evidence
goes, we should infer that the barrier was not present at the time
when the great majority of the existing plants spread into this
region; but that it has been established long enough to oppose a
limit to the further diffusion of many species that otherwise
would, in all probability, be found on both sides of the Strait,
thus indicating a period geologically recent, but very ancient as
compared with the historic record.</p>

<p>On the following morning we crossed the bay to Gibraltar, and,
still finding no means of conveyance to Tangier, endeavoured to
console ourselves by botanising on the ‘Rock.’ Later in the day the
impatience natural to the British traveller induced us to open
negotiations for the hire of one of the numerous tug steamers that
make handsome profits by helping becalmed ships through the Strait.
The first demand of one hundred dollars helped to moderate our
ardour; and, though the more reasonable sum of forty-five dollars
was afterwards named by another merchant, we finally decided to
remain a second night in Europe, and await the ordinary steamer on
the following day.</p>

<p>It is well known that all the rules which prevent unauthorised
persons from prying into the arcana of a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_61">[61]</span> fortress are strictly enforced at Gibraltar;
and on this account a naturalist wishing to explore the rock should
always apply for the previous permission of the Governor. Not
intending to remain more than a few hours, we had declined the
hospitable invitation of Sir W. F. Williams, and not thought of
obtaining an order to authorise our unrestricted rambling over the
rock. Towards evening Ball had started with his tin box to examine
the steep eastern face that looks towards the Mediterranean. While
scrambling about in search of plants, he became aware that his
movements were watched by two Irish soldiers, both decidedly the
worse for liquor, and as he returned towards the path the word
‘spy’ was emphatically pronounced more than once. Anticipating any
further unpleasant remarks, he addressed them some ordinary
question, with a fair infusion of that national accent that is
unmistakable to the Hibernian ear. The effect was immediate: the
men were delighted to recognise a countryman; question and answer
rapidly succeeded, and the only difficulty was to resist their
pressing invitation to adjourn to a neighbouring wine-shop, where
the poor fellows’ remaining intelligence would have been finally
quenched in the compound of grape-juice and ardent spirits that is
sold at Gibraltar as Spanish wine—not much worse, perhaps, than the
mixture that is drunk at home by not a few persons boasting a
refined taste under the name of pale sherry.</p>

<p>It seems natural to ask whether it is or is not true, as one is
often assured, that correct plans of all the chief fortresses in
Europe are to be found in the War Office of each of the chief
States; for in such case the attempt to maintain secrecy as against
the ignorant curiosity of travellers seems to be a puerile
occupation for the military authorities in command.</p>

<p>The rock of Gibraltar and the sandy tract called the Neutral
Ground produce many rare and interesting-plants; but these are
already well known to botanists,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_62">[62]</span> being separately described in Kelaart’s
<i>Flora Calpensis</i>, and further illustrated in a work of
first-rate authority, Boissier’s <i>Voyage Botanique en
Espagne</i>. The only tree that seems to prosper thoroughly on this
barren sun-baked headland is the Chinese <i>Phytolacca arborea</i>,
which was planted some fifty or sixty years ago in the Alameda and
elsewhere, many of which have attained a great thickness. They
remind one of the stunted clustered columns of some mediæval
churches, each of the very numerous branches developing a
projecting cylinder of woody trunk covered with grey bark.</p>

<p>The so-called Club House, which ranks as the head inn, being
already full, we put up at the Fonda Española, and had no cause for
complaint, either as to food or accommodation. On the morning of
the 17th we had notice that the steamer for Tangier was to start at
noon; and, after laying in additional stores of drying paper, and
enjoying a delightful morning stroll along the road to Europa
Point, we were ready at the appointed time.</p>

<p>After more than the usual delay, we at length set our faces
towards the African shore with a fresh SW. breeze in our faces. Few
places in the world can show a greater variety of fine atmospheric
effects than the Strait of Hercules. To-day the horizon behind us
was clear, while the hills that bound the entrance from the
Atlantic were veiled in thin haze; and, as the sun sank low, a
strange purple hue suffused one-half of the sky. The skipper
managed to arrive late in the roads at Tangier, and we found that,
although a bribe to the official of the port might obtain admission
within the walls, our baggage could not be landed until the
following morning. We therefore decided to sleep on board the
little steamer, and at length, on the morning of the 18th, we
returned to breakfast at the Victoria Hotel.</p>

<p>Maw had made good use of his time. In a first excursion to the
‘Lakes’ he had failed to find a beautiful iris, which we had first
admired on Sir J. D. Hay’s dinner-table, and which we had taken to
be the <i>Iris tingitana</i> of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_63">[63]</span> Boissier and Reuter. Not easily foiled from
his purpose, Maw returned two days later, and succeeded in his
object. Subsequent examination has convinced us that the plant
growing near the lakes is a luxuriant form of the <i>Iris
filifolia</i> of Southern Spain, though intermediate between that
and <i>I. tingitana</i>. The latter may perhaps be an extreme form
of the same plant, but is yet little known, and had not, as far as
we know, been brought into cultivation until carried to England by
Maw. Our plant, which is one of the most beautiful of a beautiful
group, is figured, under the name <i>Xyphion tingitanum</i>, in the
98th volume of the ‘Botanical Magazine,’ No. 5981. Nothing can
surpass in the scale of rich sombre decoration the gradations of
dark purple and brown velvet that enrich the petals.</p>

<p>One of the troubles that most try the patience of a botanical
traveller here awaited us. As we had already assured ourselves, the
spring climate of North Marocco is delightful to the human frame.
The sky had been clear, the air warm, and only one or two slight
showers of rain had fallen since we first landed on the coast; but
the breezes, whether they travel eastward from the Atlantic, or
westward from the Mediterranean, are laden with aqueous vapour
nearly to the point of saturation, and nothing dries spontaneously
by mere exposure to the air. Although our system of drying our
plants by ventilating gratings makes it quite unnecessary to change
the paper in such a climate as that of the Alps, or most parts of
Europe, we now found that all the collections left at Tangier were
suffering from damp, many specimens covered with mildew, and some
hopelessly destroyed. Many hours on this and the following day were
consumed in the endeavour to remedy the mischief. So far as
structure is concerned, damp, when not too long continued, does not
disorganise the tissues; but it finally removes the remaining
freshness of colour which makes the beauty of a well-dried
specimen.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we made some purchases of Fez pottery,
of which a large store is kept by a Jew dealer.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> This ware, which combines
elegance and variety of form with vigorous geometrical designs and
rough execution, is now well known to the devotees of the
prevailing fancy for ceramics, who pay in London or Paris many
times over the original price. Through the kindness of the British
Consul, Mr. White, we obtained some small specimens of a very
scarce variety of unglazed pottery, of which the decoration
consists merely in dots of black and red, forming various patterns.
These were said to be the handywork of two potters of Fez, who both
died during the last cholera epidemic.</p>

<p>During our seven days’ absence from Tangier, the vegetation had
advanced very rapidly, and many plants had come into flower during
the interval; so that we found abundant occupation, even in the
immediate neighbourhood of the town. If we had wanted further
evidence as to the character of the climate, it was afforded by the
fact of our finding the British royal fern (<i>Osmunda
regalis</i>), on bare sandstone rocks, close to the sea. In our
proverbially damp climate it requires boggy or marshy soil to grow
freely; but then, in spite of proverbs, we have fits of dry weather
during the spring, and every now and then prolonged summer
droughts, that forbid delicate ferns to flourish in exposed
situations.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 20th we were awakened by the news
that the long expected French steamer, <i>Vérité</i>, of
Marseilles, had arrived, and would depart in the afternoon on her
voyage to the Atlantic ports of Marocco and the Canary Islands. We
were fully prepared to depart; the expected autograph letter of the
Sultan had been delivered to Sir J. D. Hay, and by him to Hooker;
our heavy baggage had already been forwarded to Mogador, and we
lost no time in completing our preparations, and bidding farewell
to those whose kindness and hospitality had made our stay at
Tangier so agreeable. In quitting Martin’s Hotel, the solitary
inconvenience that we could call to mind was the swarms of flies
that invade the rooms,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_65">[65]</span> not more abundant, however, than in many
valleys of Switzerland and North Italy; and we carried away from
Tangier the impression that even on the Mediterranean shores there
are few spots that combine such advantages of climate, natural
beauty, and material comfort.</p>

<p>We found the <i>Vérité</i>, though boasting a French name, to be
a nearly new Clyde-built steamer, owned by a Marseilles Company and
commanded by Captain Abeille of that port, far better fitted up
than most of those that ply along this coast. The passengers were
few, and, as these disembarked at the intermediate ports, we at
last became the sole occupants of the state cabin. On a fine
evening, with the gentle heaving of the broad Atlantic billows to
tune all to harmony, we passed the headland of Cape Spartel, and
received the first rays of the great lanthorn as they shot out
seaward when lighted for the night.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock next morning the engines were stopped, and
going on deck we found ourselves lying some way off the shore,
opposite the mouth of the river Oued Bouregrag, that divides Sallee
from Rabat. The latter, as seen from a distance, is a place of
somewhat imposing appearance. The chief mosque has a great square
tower, rivalling those of Seville and Marocco; and a pile of modern
masonry, on a scale unknown elsewhere in modern days in this
country, marks the large barrack where the Sultan’s body-guard is
lodged when he pays his annual visit to the coast. Carpets are made
here, and also a peculiar sort of unglazed pottery, coarse in
texture, but admirable in form, and singular in
ornamentation.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> Over against Rabat, on the north side of the
river, is Sallee, once a famous place, the last outpost of Roman
civilisation, and afterwards the home of pirates who were dreaded
throughout the Mediterranean and along the coasts of France and
England. Looking at the bare coast, and the paltry groups of mud
boxes that make up a Moorish town,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_66">[66]</span> and knowing that the bar at the river’s mouth
allows, except at spring tide, the passage only of ships of small
tonnage, it seemed scarcely credible that the European Powers
should so long have allowed such a nest of hornets to flourish at
their very gates. When one reads that up to the middle of the last
century it was not a very rare thing for the ‘Sallee rovers’ to lie
under Lundy Island, and cut out Bristol merchantmen, one asks what
the British navy was about, that the malefactors and their ships
were not swept from the sea, and Sallee itself utterly destroyed.
The false humanity that caused in our time such bitter lamentations
over the chastisement of Bornean pirates had not been yet
invented.</p>

<p>We lay for the greater part of the day within some two or three
miles of the shore, but the Atlantic rollers were too heavy to
allow a nearer approach, or permit the landing of cargo. This
happens too frequently to excite remark; and these great waves,
originating in the passage of cyclones in the mid-Atlantic, often
arrive so suddenly in the calmest weather as to create a serious
danger for the seaman. At the least it is prudent to keep up a
sufficient pressure of steam in the boiler to make it easy to gain
the offing on the shortest notice; and we heard of several cases
where the coast steamers had called in succession at all the
Atlantic ports of Marocco without being able to communicate with
any one of them, and cargo and passengers had been carried on to
the Canary Islands with the uncertain prospect of being landed on
the return voyage. Fogs offer another serious impediment to
navigation on this coast. During the summer the low country for a
distance of eight or ten miles from the shore is not rarely covered
during the morning with a thick mist that clears away before
mid-day. At such times ships dare not approach the sandy coasts,
and, when the sky clears, the scarcity of landmarks makes it
extremely difficult for the seaman to ascertain his exact position.
As the same difficulty prevented us from touching Rabat on our
return voyage, we can add nothing to what has<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_67">[67]</span> been told by preceding travellers.
Counting Sallee as a suburb of the larger town, the population is
estimated at 40,000, or more than all the other Atlantic ports put
together. The inhabitants are said to suffer from three
scourges—prolonged droughts, the invasion of locusts, and, worst of
all, the annual visits of the Sultan, whose body-guard of several
thousand soldiers has to be fed at their cost.</p>

<p>To the naturalist a stay of some days at Rabat might be of great
interest if he were able to accomplish a visit to the famous forest
of Mamora, which fills a large part of the space, some twenty miles
in width, between the mouth of the Bouregrag and the larger river
Sebou that carries to the sea the drainage of the high mountains
near Fez. The scene of most of the wonderful tales that circulate
among the people of North Marocco—adventures with lions, robbers,
and other wild animals—is laid in the forest of Mamora; but
excepting one solitary plant, brought thence by the Abbé Durand—a
very distinct species of <i>Celsia</i>—nothing is known of the
fauna and flora of the forests of this part of Marocco. These
appear to cover a considerable tract parallel to the Atlantic
coast, and probably consist mainly of the cork oak, which in any
other country might become a considerable source of profit.
Eastward of the forest the country south of the Oued Sebou is a
marshy tract, breeding endemic fevers that are said to extend to
Sallee and Rabat.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the swell became more moderate, and a boat came
out with passengers, including the family of Mr. Dupuis, the
British Vice-Consul at Casa Blanca. It was decided that it would
not be safe to land cargo, so the captain resolved to start without
further delay and run for Casa Blanca—the Dar el-Beïda of the
Moors. The sun had set, and night was closing in as we approached
the low shore, where a few white houses mark a station which has
risen to some little importance owing to the preference shown for
it by French merchants, who carry on a considerable trade with the
interior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>We accepted a
courteous invitation from Mr. and Madame Dupuis, and, landing early
on the morning of the 22nd, went to breakfast at their house. A
less attractive spot than Casa Blanca it is difficult to imagine. A
featureless coast of low shelves of red sandstone rock overlaid by
stiff clay, stretches on either side in slight undulations, nowhere
rising more than a couple of hundred feet above the sea. Not a tree
gives variety to the outline or shelter from the blazing sun. The
attempts made by the few residents to cultivate the orange and
other useful trees have met with little success; and the eye seeks
in vain the gay shrubs that adorn the southern shores of the
Mediterranean. The Cistuses, Genistas, heaths, Arbutus, and myrtle,
as well as the more sober prickly oak and laurel, are all absent,
and the arborescent vegetation is almost limited to stunted bushes
of lentisk some three or four feet high.</p>

<p>As we strolled for several hours over the surrounding country,
we at once perceived the influence of new climatal conditions. It
was not that many new species marked the passage from one botanical
province to another, for to our disappointment we found very few
that we had not already gathered in North Marocco, and, excepting
one rare <i>Celsia</i>, none that were not already well known. As
elsewhere, <i>Leguminosæ</i> were predominant, and especially
trefoils and medicks; grasses were both numerous and varied in
species; and <i>Umbelliferæ</i> were represented by many
conspicuous plants, of which <i>Ferula communis</i>, growing to a
height of ten or more feet, is especially notable. In the absence
of more substantial materials, the thick stems are used for fences.
The contrast offered by the vegetation of this coast with that of
the Mediterranean shores is caused altogether by climatal
conditions, which allow one set of species to flourish while the
rest are more or less rigidly excluded.</p>

<p>The information received from our obliging hosts respecting the
country and the native population agreed<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_69">[69]</span> well enough with what we heard elsewhere. The
prejudices of the natives are not so strong as to make them
indifferent to the advantages of trade with the intrusive
Christians who are settled on the coast; and the unfortunate issue
of the last war with Spain has taught them the prudence of avoiding
wanton provocation. Whatever may be the case with the tribes
farther inland, the people of the coast provinces are quite
disposed for commercial intercourse; but the jealousy of the
authorities makes enterprise of all kinds too unsafe to be risked
by an ordinary native of the country. Some of the provincial
governors who live near the coast carry on trade with European
merchants; but for the rest such business as exists is in the hands
of the Jews. The only interference of the Government, which is at
least ostensibly dictated by a regard for the welfare of the
people, relates to the corn trade. In favourable years Marocco
produces much more grain than the population can consume, but
drought and locusts often destroy the crops throughout large
districts. The permission to export corn is therefore given or
withheld by sovereign order according to the reports received at
head-quarters. It is needless to point out how much the uncertainty
thus produced must interfere with the profits of cultivation.</p>

<p>At Casa Blanca our skipper took on board a considerable quantity
of maize for the Canary Islands, and a good many bales of hides and
wool for Marseilles; and we found the decks in some disorder when
we returned on board our steamer in the evening. All next day—the
23rd—we remained in the roads of Casa Blanca, uncertain at what
moment we should continue our voyage. The time did not hang heavily
on our hands, for we had as much work as we could accomplish in
getting our collections into tolerably good order. We here had to
deal with an enemy that was new to all of us, excepting Hooker, and
which for the next week was to cause more trouble and anxiety than
any one not a naturalist can easily realise.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_70">[70]</span> Nothing is more common with us at home
than to grumble at the dampness of the climate; and, as far as the
effects on the human animal are concerned, our complaints are
perfectly just. Air at 50° Fahr. cannot at the utmost carry more
than about 4½ grains of aqueous vapour to the cubic foot; but at
that temperature it produces, when nearly saturated, that feeling
on the nerves of the skin, familiar to every inhabitant of these
islands, which is the ordinary forerunner of colds, sore throats,
rheumatism, and many another ailment. But the botanist, to whom the
condition of his drying paper is even more important than that of
his own body, finds an easy remedy for the inconvenience. By
exposing his damp paper to a temperature of from 80° to 90° in the
sunshine, or before a fire, he readily obtains a satisfactory
degree of relative dryness, and in a very few days his specimens
are in a state to put away, and with ordinary care need give him no
further trouble. But the case is very different where the ordinary
temperature of the air in the shade is about 75°, as was the case
here, not to speak of 85° which is the common limit in the tropics.
To the human body there is nothing unpleasant in the effects of
such air when nearly saturated with vapour, and so long as the
temperature remains habitually between 70° and 80° it is decidedly
favourable to health, if not to vigorous exertion. But a cubic foot
of air at 77° contains nearly 10½ grains of vapour, and when at all
near to the point of saturation it has no perceptible drying effect
on surrounding objects, and a moderate increase of 10° or 12° Fahr.
in temperature has but a slight effect in increasing its
desiccating power. We were first struck by remarking the very long
time required to dry the decks as compared with what is usual in
the Mediterranean, and we had still more painful experience of the
difficulty of drying our paper. We were now the sole occupants of
the saloon, and our captain left us free to use every part of the
steamer; the deck was soon turned to account, cords were stretched
across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span> rigging,
even the neighbourhood of the boiler was invaded, but with
indifferent success. Few readers may care to sympathise with the
distress of a naturalist who looks on his specimens, not only as
scientific documents bringing some additions to our knowledge of
the structure and relations of the organised world, but as things
of beauty giving delight to the senses of form and colour, when,
after much pains and care, he finds the flowers change their hues
and drop off, the leaves turn black, and when mould, the sure sign
of decomposition, begins to encrust the stems and fruits.</p>

<p>At 1 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> on the morning of the 24th we
were again under steam, and soon after daylight speed was slackened
as we lay off Mazagan. The abruptness of the transition from deep
blue water in the offing to a somewhat milky green where the ship
gets into shallower water here attracted our notice. It is of
common occurrence even on coasts where there is reason to believe
that the bed of the sea shelves vary gradually away from the shore,
and one might expect a gradual change of tint; but no satisfactory
explanation occurred to us.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It was some time before the
land came in sight, and we were able to make out the square tower
of the Portuguese fort that marks the position of Mazagan. The town
stands on a slightly projecting point of land facing northward, and
therefore especially exposed to the north-east breeze that prevails
throughout the spring and summer. We lay all day rolling heavily,
and the surf, breaking in hills of foam upon the shore, was too
high to allow of the landing of cargo; but in the afternoon a small
boat put off with provisions. Amongst these was a large freshwater
fish, a species of shad, that had been caught in the Oued
Oum-er-bia which runs into<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_72">[72]</span> the sea some five miles east of Mazagan close
to the site of Azemour, a ruined town once of some importance. The
freshwater fish of the streams from the Atlas may probably offer
many objects of interest to the ichthyologist, but do not seem
likely to add much to the resources of the cook. We were told that
the fine-looking animal which was displayed at table is considered
a delicacy; but we found the flesh insipid and cottony, and during
our subsequent journey we failed to find any fish worth eating.</p>

<p>Neither on this occasion nor on our return did we see any trace
of the ruins of Azemour or of the great river Oum-er-bia. This is
apparently the chief stream of Marocco. It drains the northern
declivity of the chain of the Great Atlas for a distance of 150
miles, and nearly the entire of the extensive mountainous region, a
still unknown network of high ridges and deep valleys, that covers
nearly half the space between the main chain and the Atlantic
seaboard. Like all the other rivers of this country the volume of
water varies to an extent unknown in Europe. In dry seasons, when a
large part of the waters that descend from the mountains is
diverted into irrigation channels, and never reaches the sea, the
main stream runs over a shallow bed fordable in many places; but
after heavy rains the swollen waters have such a rapid current that
we were told of travellers being detained a week or ten days
waiting for the opportunity of crossing it. Lieut., afterwards
Admiral, Washington<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> estimated the breadth of the river where
he crossed it, near Azemour, at 150 yards, and found it much the
same at about eighty miles from the sea on the return journey from
Marocco to the coast.</p>

<p>Mazagan, though a small and poor-looking place, bears many
traces of its European origin, as we remarked when we landed here
on our return voyage from Mogador. It was built by the Portuguese
in 1566, and held in spite of frequent assaults by the Moors for
more than two hundred years, having been finally surrendered in
1770.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>We left the roads
at 9 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> on the 25th, and were glad to
see for the first time the land rising in bold cliffs. The headland
seen a few miles south-west of Mazagan is Cape Blanco; but this
projects little from the general outline of the coast, which shows
a tolerably uniform direction, rising gradually towards the
south-west, till we reach Cape Cantin, the chief headland of this
part of the Atlantic seaboard. The summit is apparently about three
hundred feet above the sea, and the calcareous strata nearly
horizontal. Here the coast line, which from Cape Blanco had kept
the direction from north-east by east to south-west by west, turns
abruptly to the south. The cliffs recede a little at first and form
a slight curve, then rising to a second headland some two hundred
feet higher than Cape Cantin. Beyond this the shore again recedes,
and the land subsides, where a slender stream has cut its way
through the plateau inland, and affords space for the little
seaport town of Saffi, or Asfi of the Moors. The coast line again
rises on the south side of Saffi, forming a steep escarpment some
three or four hundred feet in height, called the Jews’ Rock, about
four miles from the town.</p>

<p>Saffi is by far the most picturesque spot on the west coast of
Marocco. The extensive fortifications of the Portuguese, high walls
and square towers, spreading along the shore and up the broken
declivity on which the town is built, with several steep islets,
whose rocks have been gnawed into uncouth shapes by the Atlantic
waves, produce, as seen from the sea, a striking effect. Though
fully exposed to the west, this port is better protected from the
north-east winds than any other on the coast, except Mogador.
Behind it lies the fertile province of Abda, famed for its
excellent breed of horses, and it is the nearest port to the city
of Marocco—about one hundred miles distant—but the want of secure
anchorage for shipping neutralises these natural advantages.</p>

<p>Our stay on this occasion was short, and soon after dark we were
again in motion. We spent pleasantly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> enough our last evening on board the
<i>Vérité</i>. Though he took little pains to conceal his strong
prejudices against the English nation, our captain was thoroughly
good-natured and obliging towards the individual Englishmen with
whom he was associated. No doubt our scientific pursuits
recommended us to his good offices, for the slight smattering of
scientific knowledge acquired by half-educated persons in most
Continental countries has the effect of awakening some interest in
such pursuits. It may, indeed, be doubted whether, at least in
France, the teaching of physical science goes far enough to convey
any accurate knowledge, even of an elementary kind; but, at all
events, the national temperament leads Frenchmen to expose their
deficiencies more than other people readily do. An Englishman who
knows that he is not well grounded in a subject holds his tongue,
or if pressed by questions will probably exaggerate the extent of
his own ignorance, where a Frenchman will gaily lay down the law
and span over the gaps in his knowledge by startling bridges of
conjecture. Our worthy skipper amused us not a little when, in
conversation on the climate of this coast, reference being made to
the rainless zone of the Peruvian coast, he explained that in that
country the moisture of the air is absorbed by the gases that
accompany earthquakes, thus accounting to his own satisfaction for
the meteorological phenomenon. But the full vehemence of his nature
was reserved for matters of much more immediate interest. He had
left Marseilles after the Communist rising in that city had been
suppressed, but while the miserable tragic farce that was to end in
the horrors of May, 1871, was being enacted in Paris. He could not
allude to the subject without a degree of fury that to us seemed
utterly unreasonable. But it is easy for people at a distance to
treat such matters with calmness, and there were not many
Englishmen on the spot who at the time were able to share the noble
calmness of Lord Canning during the Indian Mutiny.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">At</span> 5 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> on April 26 we at length reached the port of
Mogador. Before many minutes a boat was alongside, and we were
warmly welcomed by a gentleman who introduced himself as Mr.
Carstensen, the British Vice-Consul, brother-in-law of Sir J. D.
Hay. He was, indeed, no stranger; for, as a correspondent and
active contributor to the Royal Gardens at Kew, he had long been in
friendly relations with the chief of our party. To his energetic
good offices and hospitable attentions we owe deep obligations, and
it was with sincere regret that we subsequently heard of his
premature death in 1873.</p>

<p>At an early hour we were comfortably established in the British
Consulate, where our host and hostess received us as old friends,
and we were soon engaged in discussion as to the arrangements for
the prosecution of our journey, in all of which Mr. Carstensen’s
familiarity with the country and perfect command of the language
were of the utmost value. Having received previous notice of our
arrival and of the objects of our journey, he had already prepared
the way, and thus very much abridged the delays that are inevitable
in such a country.</p>

<p>The first step necessary was to call on the Governor and present
to him the Sultan’s letter. We were courteously received by El Hadj
Hamara, a well-looking man of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_76">[76]</span> middle age, in a small plain room, whose only
furniture consisted in cushions laid round the walls. After shaking
hands in European fashion, we proceeded to seat ourselves,
cross-legged—no doubt looking very uncomfortable during the
experiment—while the Sultan’s letter was produced. This was written
on a small sheet of inferior paper, folded to the size of a note,
and sealed with coarse sealing-wax. It was received by the
Governor, the seal reverently applied to his forehead, and then
broken. After reading aloud the few lines of writing, the Governor
handed the letter to Mr. Carstensen, who proceeded to translate
literally for our benefit. It ran thus: ‘On receiving this, you
will send the English hakeem and his companions to the care of my
slave, El Graoui, to whom I have sent orders what he is to do.’ It
should be explained that El Graoui, spoken of as the Sultan’s
slave, was the Governor of the portion of the Great Atlas that is
practically subject to the Imperial authority, and precisely the
person whose favour and assistance it was essential for our objects
to secure.</p>

<p>To strangers unused to the style of the Marocco Court, the
Imperial letter did not seem a very promising document; but it was
evident that, so far as the Governor of Mogador was concerned, it
conveyed the impression that we were to be treated with respect and
attention; and this was doubtless confirmed by the arrival of a
courier from Marocco, bearing a letter from the Sultan’s eldest
son, then acting as viceroy in the southern provinces of the
empire, with orders to take every care for our safety and comfort
during the journey to the capital.</p>

<p>We soon had a specimen of the shape in which official protection
displays itself in this country. On a representation from Mr.
Carstensen that we should require numerous baggage animals, besides
horses and mules to ride, the order had gone forth a week before
our arrival that no horses or mules should be sold or hired in the
town of Mogador until we had selected such as we required. This
accordingly was one of our first cares, and the embargo<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> was raised in the course of the
day. We followed local advice, confirmed by our own previous
experience in warm countries, in choosing mules in preference to
horses. On a long journey they are far less liable to be laid up,
and, to a scientific traveller who has frequent occasion to
dismount, they give less trouble. Their obstinate temper is,
however, often annoying, and, though surefooted, they sometimes
have a very unpleasant trick of tripping or stumbling over stony
ground.</p>

<p>A precaution which we took this day is much to be recommended to
travellers. This was to make a trial of pitching our tents on a
piece of rough open ground. People readily suppose that a tent that
is easily set up in an English lawn must answer their expectations
on a march, and have little notion of the amount of discomfort
caused by trifling defects. We speedily found that the pegs
supplied in England are not nearly hard enough to pierce the
stiff-baked clay or stony paste that forms the prevailing soil in
this country; and it was fortunate for our comfort that we took
from Mogador an ample supply of rough pegs, made from the wood of
the argan tree. We were each provided with a tent which satisfied
our individual wants, but scarcely corresponded with the native
ideas of what befits personages of distinction. We were well aware
that in this country <em>prestige</em> was an essential element in
success, and therefore willingly accepted the liberal offer of a
large handsome native tent made by the local agent of Messrs. Perry
& Co. of Liverpool. This was available only for the journey across
the plains between Mogador and Marocco, as it was very heavy,
forming a load for two camels, and therefore not suitable for a
hilly country. It supplied a comparatively spacious saloon, wherein
we passed our evenings very pleasantly, before retiring to our
separate quarters for the night.</p>

<p>The next matter requiring attention was our costume. It was
foreseen that during some part of our journey, at least, it might
be expedient to adopt the native dress, or<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_78">[78]</span> such an approximation to it as would prevent
our attracting notice from afar as strange and outlandish
creatures. After due deliberation, the <i>haïk</i> was finally
rejected. This is the ordinary outer garment of natives of the
upper class. An ample robe of fine white woollen stuff is a
graceful and picturesque garment, especially on those who know how
to group its folds about the person; but it is absolutely
incompatible with the free use of the limbs, and more especially
for botanists, whose pursuit brings them into frequent contact with
the numberless spiny plants of this region. The unsightly
<i>jellabia</i>, a blouse of rough white woollen stuff, with the
addition of a hood that may be drawn over the head, was adopted,
and was not found very inconvenient.</p>

<p>Anticipating unavoidable exposure to a nearly vertical sun, we
had provided ourselves with the grey pith ventilating helmets so
commonly used by Englishmen in the tropics. It was found that by
winding round one of these a moderate strip of the usual material
for turbans, it might be made to pass muster at a distance. But for
head-gear on important occasions the turban was indispensable. The
material, a broad band of light muslin, about thirteen or fourteen
yards in length, is supplied from England, but the art of winding
it round the head requires long practice, and we always resorted to
the aid of one of our attendants. It certainly gives protection
against a hot sun; but it is never quite convenient to a European
of active habits, who finds it hard to acquire the orthodox gravity
of Oriental demeanour, and is sadly apt to disturb the folds of the
turban by some abrupt movement.</p>

<p>There was one article of dress as to which no compromise was
possible. The slippers down at heel that are commonly used by all
classes of natives, and even the red or yellow loose boots that are
sometimes worn on a journey, were equally unsuited to our habits
and pursuits, and we held fast to our accustomed foot-covering.</p>

<p>Mr. Carstensen had kindly made excellent
arrangements<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span> for our
convenience during our journey by selecting such native attendants
as we should require. One was told off to each of us as a personal
servant, expected to be always in readiness to render any required
assistance; and Hooker’s English attendant, Crump, was included in
this arrangement. This may appear superfluous, and so it might be
to ordinary travellers; but for a party of naturalists anxious to
make the best use of their time, it was almost indispensable.
Several other men were attached to the camp in various capacities,
one of the most useful being a saddler, daily in requisition to
repair damage done to leather work; but by far the most important
member of our suite was the interpreter to the British Consulate,
whose services were spared for fully five weeks. Even with Mr.
Carstensen’s thorough knowledge of the language, this must have
been felt as a serious inconvenience, for Abraham proved himself
active and intelligent; and the duties of a consular agent on the
Marocco coast being by no means of a hum-drum character, the need
of a man familiar with the country and the people in the capacity
of secretary and assistant is daily felt. Being a Marocco Jew, born
in a position of relative inferiority to his Mohammedan neighbours,
Abraham no doubt felt a keen satisfaction in the sense of security
which he derived from his position in the British service. To be
able to converse in a tone approaching to equality with powerful
officials; to emancipate oneself from restrictions trifling, yet
galling, in matters of dress and demeanour; to share in some
measure in the vague sense of power vested in the representatives
of the great European States—must be the climax of ambition to a
member of a despised nationality in a land where neither
intelligence nor wealth nor good reputation give a man security or
social recognition.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that our escort was to consist of four
soldiers, under the command of a <i>kaïd</i>, nearly equivalent, as
we were told, to a captain in European army<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_80">[80]</span> rank. This was more than was requisite for
security, as, with all its barbarism, the Marocco Government is
efficient enough within the parts of the territory where the
Sultan’s authority is recognised and feared. Within those limits it
is enough to let it be known that a traveller enjoys the Imperial
protection; no one will ever think of daring to molest him.</p>

<p>After devoting a good part of the day to indispensable
preparations for our future journey, we were free to look about us
in the singular little town which, as the chief port of South
Marocco, is the last outpost of civilisation on the African coast
at this side of the French settlements of Senegal. Like many other
places in Marocco, this owes its existence to the caprice of a
Sultan. It was founded in 1760 by Sidi Mohammed, the most energetic
of recent Moorish sovereigns, and became a considerable place when,
a few years later, the same ruler destroyed Agadir, and ordered the
merchants established there to remove to Mogador. Jackson tells us
that it received its European name from the sanctuary of Sidi
Mogodol, standing somewhere among the neighbouring sandhills; but a
town of Mogador is shown in a map published in 1608,<a id=
"FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
standing a short way north of the island, which is there marked ‘I.
Domegador.’ As have most of those marked on the early maps, the
ancient town had doubtless disappeared before the foundation of the
present one, called by the Moors Soueira; but the old name must
have survived in the country.</p>

<p>The low rocky island lying opposite to the town, and separated
by a navigable channel, affords shelter from all winds except those
from the SW.; but the depth of water is not great, and there are
numerous dangerous reefs, so that in threatening weather steam is
always kept up, and ships proceed to sea when SW. winds are
expected. Although the island is shown on the oldest maps, and the
channel is represented much as we now see it in the
plates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> to Jackson’s
work, from drawings made about the beginning of this century, we
were positively assured that old people in Mogador recollected the
time when the island was connected with the mainland by an isthmus,
over which cattle could be driven at low water; and this story
seemed to have gained credence with the European inhabitants.</p>

<p>Though it has no buildings of importance, the town is in one
respect the most habitable in Marocco, being remarkably clean, and
in that respect superior to very many seaports in Europe. This is
largely due to the efforts of two intelligent French physicians,
who have at various periods visited Mogador, but especially to the
exertions of Dr. Thevenin, who has resided there for many
years.</p>

<p>The Governor and other officials, with the European consuls and
merchants, all reside in the Kasbah—the chief of the three quarters
into which the town is divided. Here are several narrow but
regularly-built streets; the houses are mostly of two stories,
enclosing a small courtyard, which is entered by a low and narrow
doorway from the street. In the Moorish town, inhabited by natives
of the lower class, the houses are of one story, and poor in
appearance; but the practice of whitewashing within and without
once every week makes them look clean, and, no doubt, has much to
do with the remarkable immunity of this place from contagious and
endemic diseases. The Jewish town is much overcrowded; but we were
assured that even here the modern gospel of soap and water has made
much progress.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we sallied forth with our portfolios; but in
deference to public opinion, which could not endure that strangers
of consequence should be seen trudging on foot, we rode for about a
mile out of the town. Its surroundings are not prepossessing. The
low tertiary limestone rock, on which it is built, and which
doubtless extends inland for some distance, is covered up to the
city walls by blown sand, driven along the shore before the SW.
winds, forming dunes that cover the whole surface; and<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> in most directions one may ride
two or three miles before encountering any other vegetation than a
few paltry attempts at cultivating vegetables for the table within
little enclosed plots, whose owners are constantly disputing the
ground with the intrusive sand. The chief break in the monotony of
the sand ridges is due to the small stream of the Oued Kseb (called
Oued el-Ghoreb on Beaudouin’s map), which reaches the sea little
more than a mile away on the south side of the town. Much of the
water being diverted, the current is not strong enough to keep a
channel through the sands, but forms at its mouth a marsh, where
many of the most interesting plants of the neighbourhood are to be
found. The drip from the small aqueduct that supplies water to the
town suffices to give nourishment to other less uncommon
species.</p>

<p>Mogador has long been tolerably well known to botanists. It was
visited by Broussonet at the latter end of the last century, and
was for some time the residence of Schousboë. More recently the
neighbourhood has been explored by the late Mr. Lowe and by M.
Balansa. We could not, therefore, reasonably expect to find here
anything new to science; but our short excursion was nevertheless
full of interest, though not altogether of an agreeable kind. We
here saw for the first time a district recently ravaged by locusts;
and while we acquired a lively sense of the amount of mischief
effected by these destructive creatures, we also found out how it
happens that the damage is confined within tolerable limits; how,
in short, they fail to turn the country into a desert. When one
reads the reports of credible eye-witnesses, who describe the
arrival of swarms of locusts that devour every green thing, one
asks oneself how it can be possible for man or animals to survive
such destruction. In the first place, it may be remarked that, like
most other sweeping statements, these are not strictly true. The
locusts do not, in point of fact, devour every green thing. In the
spots where they were most destructive we always
remarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> that certain
plants escaped untouched. The result of this immunity would
naturally be to substitute the latter for the species destroyed by
the locusts, were there not some very efficient agency for
repairing the damage and maintaining the life of the species, if
not of the individual. An important element in considering this
question is the season at which the mischief is effected. The young
locust grows very fast, and it is mainly during the period of
growth that it consumes vegetation. When once the animal has
attained its full size, it becomes comparatively inert, and its
capacity for destruction is vastly diminished. If the swarm of
young locusts arrives before the middle of April, when the rainy
season is not quite over, the first showers revive the plants that
have been devoured almost to the root with surprising rapidity.
Perennial species throw out new buds, and are soon again covered
with leaf and flower; and the same often happens with annuals,
unless these have already shed their seed, and then a new crop soon
reappears. It may be supposed that the vast amount of decaying
animal matter left on the surface, even in the most barren spot,
contributes not a little to the vigour of the vegetation, and thus
compensates for the destruction effected at an earlier stage. It is
when the swarms appear late, and attack the wheat or maize after
the flowers are developed, that the consequences to the population
are very serious, and famines result that periodically affect large
districts.</p>

<p>In the present year it was clear that rain had fallen since the
locust invasion, and although much damage had been done, tolerable
specimens of many plants here seen for the first time were to be
found. A few of these are common to the Canary Islands and this
part of Africa; others are not yet known except on this coast. The
most curious of them is the <i>Senecio</i> (<i>Kleinia</i>)
<i>pteroneura</i>, whose succulent almost leafless branches, as
thick as a man’s finger, bear a few heads of flowers that differ
little, save in their larger size, from those of the common
groundsel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> Well
pleased with our first glance at the South Marocco flora, we
returned to our comfortable quarters, and spent a pleasant evening
in discussing our future movements, and in drawing upon our host’s
ample stores of information respecting the country and its
inhabitants.</p>

<p>We were now for the first time brought into contact with the
primitive stock of this part of Africa, one main branch of the
Bereber race, which is distinguished by speaking some dialect of
the Shelluh (Shleuh) language.<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The affinity of this people
with the Berebers of the Lesser Atlas—including under that name the
Kabyles of Algeria, with the Riff tribes of North-west Marocco—has
been denied, but does not appear to be open to reasonable doubt.
The type is physically the same, excepting among some of the tribes
south of the Great Atlas, where the intermixture of Negro blood has
introduced new and very diverse elements. The languages now spoken
among these tribes doubtless exhibit marked differences, especially
to the ear of a foreigner. Jackson long ago denied the relationship
between the Shelluh and the Bereber, while Washington, in the paper
already quoted, came to a contrary conclusion. It may now be
considered as beyond question that the differences between the
Shelluh and the Kabyle are merely dialectic.<a id=
"FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
The value of linguistic evidence in ethnological inquiries has of
late been questioned by eminent critics, and it must be conceded
that such evidence, when it merely rests on lexicographical
coincidences, is of less value than when it is derived from
grammatical structure; yet, after all deductions, the facts remain
to be accounted for, and, in the absence of proof to the contrary,
it goes far towards proving community of origin. It must be
remembered, that unlettered races are subject to far greater and
more rapid changes of dialect<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_85">[85]</span> than those who preserve in sacred books or
popular poetry fixed standards of correct speech; add to this, the
chances of error when a traveller, communicating with a native
through an interpreter, and contending with sounds unusual to his
ear, attempts to form a vocabulary. These causes, acting together,
tend to increase the difficulty of recognizing linguistic
affinities that really exist.</p>

<p>In the absence of any indication of the intrusion of a
conquering race that can be supposed to have imposed its language
on the previous population, it seems most probable that the native
races of North Africa, between the Libyan Desert and the Atlantic
coast, including also the Canary Islands, all belong to a single
stock, which may best be called Bereber. The two main branches are
both mountain peoples. To the north we have the tribes of the
Lesser Atlas, extending from the gates of Tetuan to the hill
country of Tunis, who may best bear the common name of Kabyles—to
the south-west the population of the Great Atlas, from the
neighbourhood of Fez to the coast between Agadir and Oued Noun,
broken up into numerous tribes, but all speaking some dialect of
the same language, and thence called generically Shelluhs. Of the
scattered fragments of the Bereber stock that have spread far
through the oases of the Great Desert, till they have come into
contact with the Negro tribes from the south of that barrier, our
information is still most imperfect. In constant conflict with each
other, and with the Arab and Negro tribes who dispute with them the
scanty means of subsistence that Nature here provides, they appear
on the whole to predominate over their competitors. The Touarecks,
scattered over a territory as large as half of Europe, from Algeria
to Soudan, form a separate branch of the same stock; while we learn
from Gerhard Rohlfs that the predatory tribes of the desert south
of Marocco are merely Shelluhs who have changed their habits and
manner of life to suit altered conditions of existence.</p>

<p>The character of the Bereber has scarcely received<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> justice at the hands either of
ancient or modern writers. They have been inconvenient neighbours
for those who have sought to encroach on their territory, and they
are justly dreaded by the traveller through the Great Desert as the
most active and enterprising of the human enemies he must confront
or evade. Comparing them with the Moor and Arab population of South
Marocco, our report agrees with that of Jackson, who probably knew
them better than any other European has done. They are decidedly
superior in intelligence, in industry, and general activity to
their neighbours. Two of our retinue, selected by Mr. Carstensen
among the mountaineers who resort to Mogador to pick up a living
about the port, distinguished themselves over all the rest both in
physical and mental qualities; and one of these especially, who
became Hooker’s personal attendant, showed an amount of general
intelligence and unfailing cheerfulness that made him a favourite
with the entire party.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th we made an excursion to the island.
It is formed of an irregular, low, knobby mass of very friable
tertiary rock, which seems to yield rapidly to the erosive action
of the heavy waves that almost constantly break on its seaward
face, where the overhanging cliffs are hollowed into caverns. At
the time of our visit it appeared to be uninhabited. Two or three
heavy pieces of cannon, honeycombed with rust, lay near the highest
point, but seemed never to have been placed in position. A small
building was said to have been sometimes used for the custody of
State prisoners, but otherwise there was no indication here of the
presence of man. In such a spot we expected to find the coast
vegetation fully developed, but we counted without the locusts.
Nowhere else did we observe such complete destruction. A good many
plants growing on the rocks, within constant reach of the
sea-spray, had escaped; but on the rest of the island scarcely a
green leaf remained, and it required a patient search to discover a
few fruits of some leguminous plants<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_87">[87]</span> that appear to abound in this locality. Of
the seaside rock-plants three were supposed to be peculiar to this
single spot. <i>Andryala mogadorensis</i>, of Cosson, a very showy
species of an unattractive genus, has been well figured in the
‘Botanical Magazine’ for 1873; <i>Frankenia velutina</i>, the most
ornamental species of that variable genus, appeared at first quite
distinct, but we were afterwards led to suspect it to be a local
form or subspecies of the widely spread perennial <i>Frankenia</i>,
so common in the Mediterranean region. Both of these we afterwards
found on the coast near Saffi. Of the third plant—<i>Asteriscus
imbricatus</i>, of Decandolle—but a single stunted specimen was
found by Ball, and as yet it has no other known habitat. We here
saw for the first time a plant which turned out to be rather common
in South Marocco, and which was taken by us, as it had been by
preceding botanists, to be the <i>Apteranthes Gussoniana</i>, of
Mikan, first described by Gussone as <i>Stapelia europæa</i>, and
in truth closely resembling in habit and appearance some of the
South African species of <i>Stapelia</i>. The fruit, which we
afterwards found in abundance, did not appear different from that
of Gussone’s plant; but when the specimens carried to England by
Maw flowered two years later, the structure of the flower showed
that it should be recognised as a distinct species of the group
which has received the generic name <i>Boucerosia</i>, and it was
accordingly published by Hooker, in the ‘Botanical Magazine’ (No.
6137), under the name <i>Boucerosia maroccana</i>.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we called on Monsieur Beaumier, the
French Consul, in company with Dr. Thevenin, an intelligent
physician, who has spent several years at Mogador, much to the
advantage of the inhabitants whether Christian or native. M.
Beaumier not only received us with the proverbial courtesy of his
country, but showed a warm interest in the success of our journey,
and kindly supplied us with many items of information, along with
manuscript notes prepared by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_88">[88]</span> himself during his residence in South
Marocco. His premature death, from an illness contracted during a
visit to France in 1875, has been a serious loss to the country
which he had made his second home.</p>

<p>Amongst other items of information, we owe to M. Beaumier a
series of meteorological observations carried on at Mogador with a
single interruption for nearly nine years, and supplying all
requisite particulars for eight complete years. The results are so
remarkable that they have attracted the attention of many
physicians, and may probably lead at some not distant date to the
selection of this place as a sanitarium for consumptive
patients.</p>

<p>Dr. Thevenin mentioned several facts of much interest in their
bearing on this question. In the first place, phthisis is all but
completely unknown among the inhabitants of this part of Africa;
while in Algeria cases are not rare among the natives, and in Egypt
they are rather frequent. In the course of ten years he had met but
five cases among his very numerous native patients, and in three of
these the disease had been contracted at a distance. He further
mentioned several cases among Europeans who had arrived in an
advanced stage of the disease, on whom the influence of the climate
had exercised a remarkable curative effect.</p>

<p>An examination of the tables, showing the results of M.
Beaumier’s observations, and especially those for temperature, may
help to explain these facts, as they certainly show that Mogador
enjoys a more equable climate than any place within the temperate
zone as to which we possess accurate information.</p>

<p>It should be mentioned that these observations were made with
good instruments, sufficiently well situated on the shady side of
the open court-yard of the French Consulate, about thirty feet
above the sea level. The hours of observation were 8 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span>, 2 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, and 10
<span class="sc2">P.M.</span>—not perhaps the best that could be
selected, but sufficient in a climate where rapid transitions are
unknown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>A few of the
results here stated in Fahrenheit’s scale are derived from M.
Beaumier’s tables as continued to the end of 1874:—</p>

<p class="nind">showing a difference of only 10° of Fahrenheit’s
scale between the hottest and coldest months. It has not been
possible to ascertain accurately the daily range of the
thermometer, as there were no self-recording instruments employed;
but there is reason to believe that this would exhibit a still more
remarkable proof of the equability of the climate. So far as the
observations go they show an ordinary daily range of about 5°
Fahr., and rarely exceeding 8° Fahr. It may be added, that in the
course of six weeks from our arrival on April 26 to our departure
on June 7, the lowest night temperature observed at Mogador was 61°
Fahr., and the highest by day 77° Fahr.</p>

<p>If the climate of Mogador be compared with that of such places
as Algiers, Madeira (Funchal), and Cairo, which have nearly the
same mean winter temperature, it will be found that in each of
those places the mercury is occasionally liable to fall
considerably below 50°, and that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_90">[90]</span> the summer heat is greatly in excess of the
limits that suit delicate constitutions, the mean of the three
hottest months being about 80° Fahr. at Algiers, about 82° at
Funchal, and 85° at Cairo. It will help to complete the impression
as to the Mogador climate to say, that rain falls on an average on
forty-five days in the year; and that, per 1,000 observations on
the state of the sky, the proportions are</p>

<p class="nind">the latter entry referring to days when a fog or
thick haze prevails in the morning, but disappears before mid-day.
The desert wind is scarcely felt at Mogador. On an average it blows
on about two days in each year, and on these rare occasions it has
much less effect on the thermometer than it has in Madeira,
doubtless owing to the protective effect of the chain of the Great
Atlas.</p>

<p>These remarkable climatal conditions have been mainly attributed
to the influence of the north-east trade wind, which sets along the
coast, and prevails, especially in summer, throughout a great part
of the year; the average of north and north-east winds being about
271 days out of 365. West and south-west winds blow chiefly in
winter on about fifty-seven days in each year, and variable winds
from the remaining four points prevail on an average of
thirty-seven days. The north-east breeze, increasing in force as
the sun approaches the meridian, maintains the exceptionally cool
summer temperature already indicated as characteristic of the
Mogador climate—a privilege which is not shared by Saffi or
Mazagan, where the summer heat is sometimes excessive. It must be
noted that although the summer temperature of the interior of
Marocco is much higher than that of Mogador, it yet falls far short
of what is found in places lying in the same latitude in North
Africa or Asia. This is evidently owing to the influence of the
Great Atlas chain, with its branches that diverge northward towards
the Mediterranean, which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> screen the entire region from the burning
winds of the desert, and send down streams that cover the land with
vegetation.</p>

<p>When one comes to consider how it happens that a place
possessing such extraordinary natural advantages has not become
frequented by the class of invalids to whom climate offers the only
chance of recovering health, or prolonging life, the obvious answer
is, that invalids cannot live on air alone, and that few persons in
that condition have the courage to select a place where they may
reasonably expect much difficulty in procuring the comforts and
even the necessaries of life, competent medical advice, and some
reasonable opportunities for occupation or amusement. The
difficulties under the first two heads are perhaps not very
serious. Lodging and food may apparently be procured on reasonable
terms, and for many years past there has always been a competent
French physician residing here. The resources of the place in point
of society are of course limited, and must vary with the arrival
and departure of the few European residents; but any one fortunate
enough to be interested in any branch of natural history would find
constant occupation of an agreeable kind in a place where there are
not half a dozen days in the year that may not be agreeably passed
out of doors.<a id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A special subject, to be earnestly recommended to any competent
inquirer, whether invalid or not, who may pass six months at
Mogador, is the language and ethnology of the Shelluh branch of the
Bereber race. Many of these mountain people come to seek a living
at Mogador, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> from
our experience it would not be difficult to find one who would
become a useful servant.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we visited the extensive stores of
Messrs. E. Bonnet & Co., who export large quantities of olive oil
from the neighbouring provinces. By increased care in the
preparation and subsequent purification of the oil, its quality has
been much improved. The cultivation of the vine has of late rapidly
increased, and wine of tolerable quality has taken a place among
the products which Marocco supplies to England.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that we had heard of the excellence of the
climate, we had to confess that at this season Mogador is not a
paradise for the botanist. The NNE. winds come saturated with
vapour, and charged with minute particles of salt from the breaking
of the Atlantic waves on the reefs near the town; and, as the
temperature of the land is scarcely higher than that of the sea,
the air has little or no drying effect on paper and plants. The
consequence was that Mr. Carstensen’s kitchen was used both by day
and night to save our specimens from destruction by damp.</p>

<p>As our interpreter, besides the cook and one or two more of our
retinue, were Jews, it was decided that, in order to spare their
feelings and those of the Jewish community in Mogador in respect to
the Sabbath, we should despatch them along with our heavy baggage
on April 28, while we should follow on the succeeding day to the
spot where they were to await us. Later in the day, after
completing the arrangements for our journey, we went by invitation
to dine with the Governor. We found that our host had had a table
prepared with chairs for Mrs. Carstensen, who with two European
ladies graced the entertainment. Beside them a carpet was spread
for Mr. Carstensen and our party; while the Governor himself, with
three native functionaries, sat in their usual fashion,
cross-legged, on another carpet several yards distant. The first
preliminary was the washing of fingers. One attendant<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> bore water, another a brass bowl
or basin, and a third presented to each in turn an embroidered
towel. This process is always repeated at the close of dinner, and
is common to all classes in the country. The feast then began, as
every well-ordered Moorish banquet must do, by green tea. Three
cups, carefully prepared in the presence of the guests, in a silver
teapot half filled with sugar, were handed in succession to each,
and then fresh tea, with mint leaves added, is again prepared, and
of this decoction the natives usually take one or two cups more.
The serious part of the repast then followed. A large dish of
coarse earthenware, covered with a conical cap of fine straw, twice
the size of a beehive, is laid on a low wooden frame in the centre
of the circle of guests. On the present occasion duplicate dishes
were prepared for us, and for the Governor and his native friends.
When the cover was removed, we were introduced to the national dish
which was destined to be our frequent acquaintance during our
journey in the South. The basis of <i>keskossou</i> is coarse
wheaten, or sometimes millet flour, cooked with butter, for which
oil is occasionally substituted. To this is added mutton, lamb, or
fowls, cut up into pieces, with various vegetables, either laid on
the farinaceous substratum or mixed up with it. Numerous dishes
succeeded each other, but they appeared to be all variations on the
same gastronomic theme. The cookery on this occasion was better
than we often found it; but the pervading flavour of rancid butter,
long kept in great earthen pots, is repulsive to European stomachs,
and few strangers are ever fortunate enough to be able to enjoy
Moorish feasts. To some of us this was the first occasion for
practising the art of eating with our fingers, and it was lucky
that our host was not at hand to observe the awkwardness of our
first essays. We improved somewhat with practice, but never could
approach the dexterity and neatness with which the natives
accomplish the operation, using only the fingers of the right hand.
Conversation was completely<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_94">[94]</span> drowned during dinner by the native music
provided in compliment to the distinguished guests. Four men,
squatting on the ground, struck the stretched metal strings of an
instrument somewhat resembling a very rude Tyrolese <i>zither</i>,
and kept up a constant chant or recitation in loud nasal tones,
very different from the slow monotonous almost always melancholy
songs of the Arabs in the East. These men, on the contrary,
declaimed the words with unflagging energy, as though determined
that the hearers should understand the story; and it was a moment
of intense relief when at the end of dinner the deafening clang of
strings and voices ceased. The fingers were again washed, green tea
again served, courtesy requiring that each guest should take at
least three cups, and then the Governor and his friends advanced
and joined our party.</p>

<p>Mr. Carstensen had asked permission to bring some wine for our
use during dinner, and afterwards naturally took the occasion to
invite the Moors present to take a share. With very slight show of
reluctance, they accepted; and, though the quantity consumed was
but trifling, the effect was unmistakable. The conversation became
very lively, and jokes passed which excited peals of laughter,
though most of them evaporated in the process of translation. One
of the Moorish guests—Director of the Tobacco monopoly, as we were
told—from the first struck us as a man of jovial temperament; and
on him the extra glass or two of wine had a potent effect, the
jollity culminating in an extemporised dance, reminding one of the
dancing bears, once the delight of our youth, that have disappeared
since the era of Zoological Gardens. The copious doses of green tea
did not prevent some of the party from sleeping; while others sat
up till near morning, engaged in the almost hopeless endeavour to
get large piles of botanical paper thoroughly dry, before we
finally started on our journey into the interior.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> morning of Saturday,
April 29, was fixed for our departure from Mogador, and about 7
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span> all were ready to start.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carstensen, with a rather numerous party of the
European residents at Mogador, had arranged to escort us for a
distance of some seven miles; and it was agreed that, instead of
following the direct road to the city of Marocco, which runs about
ENE. from Mogador, we should make a detour nearly at right angles
to that direction, or about SSE., so as to gain a fuller
acquaintance with the Argan forest.</p>

<p>Our course lay in the same direction that we had chosen in our
first short excursion from the town. Between the belt of sandy
shore that is daily washed by the tide, and the sand dunes that
rose in undulations on our left, we rode past the mouth of the Oued
Kseb, and then began to ascend over sandy dunes, whereon the
prevailing plant is <i>Genista monosperma</i>, the R’tam of the
Arabs, whose slender silvery branches wave in the slightest breeze.
Several of the peculiar plants of this coast occurred at intervals,
such as <i>Cheiranthus semperflorens</i>, <i>Statice mucronata</i>,
a curious and somewhat ornamental species,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_96">[96]</span> and two or three kinds of <i>Erodium</i>. As
the track rises and recedes a little from the coast, the tertiary
calcareous rock that underlies the sandhills crops out here and
there, and the first Argan trees begin to show themselves. As we
advanced, the trees grew larger and nearer together, and as we
approached our intended halt, at a place called Douar Arifi, they
formed a continuous forest.</p>

<p>The Argan tree is in many respects the most remarkable plant of
South Marocco; and it attracts the more attention as it is the only
tree that commonly attains a large size, and forms a conspicuous
feature of the landscape in the low country near the coast. In
structure and properties it is nearly allied to the tropical genus
<i>Sideroxylon</i> (Iron-wood); but there is enough of general
resemblance, both in its mode of growth and its economic uses, to
the familiar olive tree of the Mediterranean region to make it the
local representative of that plant. Its home is the sub-littoral
zone of South-western Marocco, where it is common between the
rivers Tensift and Sous. A few scattered trees only are said to be
found north of the Tensift; but it seems to be not infrequent in
the hilly district between the Sous and the river of Oued Noun,
making the total length of its area about 200 miles. Extending from
near the coast for a distance of thirty or forty miles inland, it
is absolutely unknown elsewhere in the world. The trunk always
divides at a height of eight or ten feet from the ground, and sends
out numerous spreading, nearly horizontal branches. The growth is
apparently very slow, and the trees that attain a girth of twelve
to fifteen feet are probably of great antiquity. The minor branches
and young shoots are beset with stiff thick spines, and the leaves
are like those of the olive in shape, but of a fuller green,
somewhat paler on the under side. Unlike the olive, the wood is of
extreme hardness, and seemingly indestructible by insects, as we
saw no example of a hollow trunk. The fruit, much like a large
olive in appearance, but varying much in size and
shape,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> is greedily
devoured by goats, sheep, camels, and cows, but refused by horses
and mules; its hard kernel furnishes the oil which replaces that of
the olive in the cookery of South Marocco, and is so unpleasant to
the unaccustomed palate of Europeans. The annexed cut, showing an
average Argan, about twenty-five feet in height, and covering a
space of sixty or seventy feet in diameter, with another, where
goats are seen feeding on the fruit, exhibits a</p>

<figure class="iw2" id="i05"><img src='images/i05.jpg' alt=''>

</figure>
</div>

<p class="nind">scene which at first much amused us, as we had not
been accustomed to consider the goat as an arboreal
quadruped.<a id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> Owing to the spreading habit of the branches,
which in the older trees approach very near to the ground, no young
seedlings are seen where the trees are near together, and but
little vegetation, excepting small annuals; but<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> in open places, and on the outer
skirts of the forest, there grows in abundance a peculiar species
of Thyme (<i>T. Broussonnetii</i>), with broadly ovate leaves and
bracts that are coloured red or purple, and the characteristic
strong scent of that tribe. It is interesting to the botanist as an
endemic species, occupying almost exactly the same geographical
area as the Argan. As we afterwards found, it is replaced in the
interior of the country by an allied, but quite distinct, species.
Its penetrating odour seems to be noxious to moths, as the dried
twigs and leaves are much used in Mogador, and found effectual for
the preservation of woollen stuffs.</p>

<p>Not many flowering plants were seen in the shade of the Argan
trees; the only species worthy of note being a very slender annual
Asphodel (<i>A. tenuifolius</i>), and <i>Carum mauritanicum</i>—a
plant somewhat resembling our British pignut.</p>

<p>Meanwhile carpets had been spread under the shade of one of the
largest Argan trees, and a copious breakfast was displayed. Fully
an hour had been consumed between eating and conversation and the
parting cigar, when, bidding farewell to our friends, we finally
started on our road for the interior, under the guardianship of the
worthy old Kaïd who commanded our escort. Separated from our
interpreter and our luggage, we felt ourselves at first strangely
isolated; but thanks to the cheerful readiness of our Shelluh
attendants, and especially of Omback, who had been specially
assigned to Hooker, this impression soon wore off. Our men had been
engaged in unloading cargo from English ships in the port of
Mogador, and had commenced the study of the English tongue by
picking up about a dozen words from the sailors. They at once
showed themselves anxious to add to their store, and the result was
that all, but especially Omback, gained such a smattering of the
language as served our purpose for many of the ordinary purposes of
life. ‘Catch him flower’ became the ordinary way of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> desiring a man to gather some
plant by the wayside, and many similar phrases soon passed current
between us. The only term of disapproval in use with our men was
‘bloody dog,’ and this was not seldom applied to the mules whenever
they gave trouble, as those creatures are wont to do.</p>

<p>As we rode on, the Argan forest grew thinner, the trees were
gradually intermixed with other species, amongst which we noted a
few specimens of <i>Callitris quadrivalvis</i>—the <i>Arar</i> of
the Moors—and before long we gained, from the brow of a low hill
where the forest ceased altogether, a rather wide view over a
country not altogether unlike some parts of England. The hills of
the province of Haha rise in successive undulations as they recede
from the coast in sloping downs, relieved at intervals by clumps of
trees, and elsewhere broken by masses of low shrubs. The calcareous
rock, which seems never far from the surface, is thinly covered
over with red earth; and patches of cultivation, chiefly barley or
wheat, the former now nearly ripe, here and there indicated the
presence of man somewhere within reach, but seemed to show that he
plays a subordinate part in fashioning the appearance of the
country. The prevailing bush or small tree is <i>Zizyphus
Lotus</i>, whose double sets of thorns—one pointing forward and the
other curved back—were destined to plague us throughout all the low
country of South Marocco. The <i>Zizyphus</i> was often quite
covered over by climbing plants, that rise ten or twelve feet from
the ground. The most frequent of these, an <i>Ephedra</i> and an
<i>Asparagus</i>, do not appear to require any special organs of
attachment. Probably the intricate branches and complex spines of
the <i>Zizyphus</i> render these superfluous.</p>

<p>Soon after this we first met bushes of one of the peculiar
plants of South Marocco, then little known, and of which we were
not able to learn much by personal inspection. The <i>Acacia
gummifera</i> of Willdenow is one of a group of allied species of
which the remainder inhabit Upper Egypt and Nubia, while one, at
least, is widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
spread throughout Eastern Africa and Arabia. The tasteless gum
known as the gum-arabic of commerce is probably produced by several
of these species. Like its allies, the South Marocco plant flowers
late in the year, after the first autumn rains, and ripens its pods
during the winter. Hence, as seen by us in spring, without flower
or fruit, there was little to distinguish this from several of the
other forms of this group.<a id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Among herbaceous plants that attracted our notice was
<i>Glaucium corniculatum</i> (here always orange, and never crimson
as it is in Palestine), with <i>Campanula dichotoma</i>, only just
coming into flower, whilst two or three degrees farther north, in
Palestine and Syria, it usually flowers three weeks earlier. More
interesting, as being one of the few local plants common to South
Marocco and the Canary Islands, was the <i>Linaria sagittata</i>
(<i>Antirrhinum sagittatum</i> of Poiret), very unlike any other
toadflax in the form of its leaves and its much branched twining
stems that spread far and wide over the low bushes.</p>

<p>Although the air was cooled by a pleasant breeze, the direct
rays of the sun were very powerful, and we were glad to make a
short halt for luncheon near a well, where a small ruined building
of rough masonry gave a narrow fringe of shadow. Resuming our
route, we soon after recrossed the sluggish stream of the Oued
Kseb, whose banks were fringed with <i>Vitex Agnus castus</i>, and
with <i>Cyperaceæ</i> not yet in flower. We took this at the time
for one of the branches of a river shown on the French map as
falling into the Atlantic north of the Djebel Hadid, some twenty
miles from Mogador; but we afterwards came to the conclusion that
no such river is in existence.</p>

<p>At or near the ford is the boundary of the province<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> of Shedma, much less extensive
than that of Haha, but apparently more fertile. The soil now
sensibly improved, and there were indications of more careful
husbandry. At the same time the larger portion of the surface
remained in a state of nature, and gratified our botanical
appetites by a display of many novelties. The varied species of
<i>Genista</i>, that are so conspicuous in North Marocco and the
Spanish peninsula, were here little seen, but are replaced by
several allied genera. <i>Cytisus albidus</i> and <i>Anagyris
fœtida</i> are especially prominent. <i>Withania fruticosa</i>, a
curious Solanaceous shrub, which we had already seen near Casa
Blanca and during the morning ride, here became extremely common;
but what most interested us was <i>Linaria ventricosa</i> of
Cosson, a large species, with stiff erect branches three or four
feet in height, first found in the adjoining province of Haha by M.
Balansa, and which we afterwards saw to be widely spread through
South Marocco, and one of the characteristic features of the
flora.</p>

<p>The dwarf fan-palm (<i>Chamærops humilis</i>, or palmetto of the
Spaniards), much less common in Marocco than it is in the hotter
parts of Southern Europe, was here rather abundant, perhaps because
it is one of the few plants that the locusts are unable or
unwilling to devour.</p>

<p>As we rode onward, gradually ascending over a gently undulating
country, this became constantly more productive. In two or three
places the people were cutting tolerable crops of ripe corn; the
olive, fig, and pomegranate became frequent, and for the first and
last time we saw the former tree cultivated with care, pruned, and
apparently manured.</p>

<p>The sun had just set when we at length reached our camp outside
the large castle of the Governor of Shedma, and found our
interpreter and other attendants anxiously awaiting our arrival.
The tents were already pitched, and our heavy luggage was in its
place. We should have been glad to eat a moderate repast in peace,
lay out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> plants
collected during the day, and retire to rest; but that would have
been nowise suitable to the dignity of a party travelling under the
especial protection of the Sultan, and whose importance had
doubtless been exaggerated to the utmost by the inventive talents
of our interpreter. In the absence of the Governor, his son, a
stout overfed man of forty, welcomed us on our arrival, and invited
us to dine in the <i>kasbah</i>, and of course courtesy required us
to accept the invitation. After a brief toilet, we proceeded to
enter the castle, and were led through open spaces to the inner
building, which forms the dwelling of the Governor, and then
through a court, with flower-plots in the centre, to a large and
handsome hall, where we were to be entertained. As usual, there was
little furniture, save several showy Rabat carpets, but we noticed
three or four ornamental French timepieces in a recess where it
would appear that the Governor or his son were used to sleep.
Besides our host, there was present a grave man whose features
differed much from the ordinary Moorish type. He turned out to be a
Turk who had already passed several months as a guest in the
Governor’s castle. We never understood accurately what had brought
him so far from Istamboul; but we were led to believe that he had
come on some informal mission, and that its traditional jealousy of
foreigners, nowise confined to Christians, had led the Moorish
Court to interpose obstacles in the way of his advance into the
country.</p>

<p>After a quarter of an hour’s interchange of civil speeches,
conversation began to flag; but the Governor’s cook, who perhaps
wished to display his professional skill on the occasion, was yet
far from completing his operations. Quite an hour passed, we were
tired and sleepy, and our fat host showed no talent for
conversation, so that the time hung heavily enough until the usual
preface to dinner, green tea, was introduced. Doubtless the
entertainment was everything that a Moorish connoisseur<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span> would have thought refined and
exquisite. Orange-flower water was provided for washing the
fingers, and incense was burned at the beginning of the repast. Our
host was attentive enough to pick out and present to us choice
pieces of meat or vegetable from the dishes that followed each
other in slow order, but he fortunately did not think it necessary
to show the utmost mark of hospitable attention by taking an
especially delicate morsel from his own mouth and thrusting it into
that of a guest. It was quite ten o’clock when, after further
potations of green tea, we returned to our tents. Presently Hooker
was requested, through Abraham, our interpreter, to receive the
<i>mona</i>, or offering of food, which, in accordance with the
Sultan’s order, was to be provided at each place where we stopped
on our journey. The <i>mona</i> on this occasion befitted the
dignity of the Governor of an important province rather than the
wants of three travellers who had just been abundantly fed, and
whose retinue could not, with the best intentions, consume one half
of the articles supplied.</p>

<p>Opposite the door of our large tent a number of the Governor’s
servants appeared, the whole group being lit up by torchlight.
First, five live sheep were dragged forward, then twenty fowls,
then followed a large hollow dish filled with eggs. To these
succeeded a very large earthen jar of butter, and another of honey,
a package of green tea, four loaves of sugar, candles of French
manufacture, which are largely imported, and finally corn for our
horses and mules. As if all this were not enough, there then
advanced a procession of men, carrying the usual large dishes with
beehive covers, each of which in turn was laid down before Hooker.
It may be here mentioned that the presentation of <i>mona</i> was
henceforward a daily ceremony, repeated every evening, some time
after our arrival in camp. The requisition was made by the soldiers
of our escort upon the local authority, whether a governor or a
mere village sheik; and this was a part of their duties which they
performed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span> with
unfailing zeal and punctuality. On such an occasion as the present
we had no fear of pressing too hardly on the donors of the
<i>mona</i>; but in poor places, and especially in the valleys of
the Great Atlas, we had an unpleasant feeling that the exorbitant
demands of our rapacious escort imposed a heavy tax on the limited
means of the population.</p>

<p>Struggling against sleep, we diligently worked at our plants
till long past midnight, and then, at length, sought rest after our
first day’s journey in South Marocco. On the morning of April 30,
we were up betimes, and had an opportunity of viewing the
<i>kasbah</i>. It is a large pile of building, enclosed by a high
wall, within which there is space for great numbers of horses,
camels, and domestic animals of all kinds, with dwellings for the
numerous retainers and rooms for guests, all separate from the
central block which forms the residence of the great man, his
family, and personal attendants. Except that it is mainly built of
<i>tapia</i>, or blocks of mud, rammed into square moulds and
hardened in the sun, this and other similar buildings in Marocco
differ little from the castles which the semibarbarous feudal
chiefs inhabited throughout a great part of Europe in the so-called
ages of chivalry, and down to the beginning of the last century. A
more extended acquaintance with the country afterwards showed
further points of comparison. There is not one of these
<i>kasbahs</i> that has not been the scene of atrocious deeds of
cruelty and treachery, such as we find in the records of most of
our mediæval strongholds. When we shudder at tales of Moorish
atrocities we are apt to forget that they merely disclose an
anachronism, no way surprising in a country that has stood
altogether aloof from the influences that have brought Europe to a
condition of relative civilisation.</p>

<p>The <i>kasbah</i> of Shedma is well placed, on nearly flat
ground, at the summit of one of the highest of the undulating hills
that intervene between the coast and the great plain of Marocco,
standing, by our measurements, 1,430<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_105">[105]</span> feet (436 mètres) above the sea level. The
view over the gently heaving surface of the lower hills to the
south was very pleasing. The slopes covered with short herbage, the
green now beginning to turn brown and yellow, are studded with
trees, chiefly Argan, olive, and fig, sometimes in clumps,
sometimes dotted over the surface. Close to us, adjoining the gate
of the <i>kasbah</i>, were several very fine Argan trees just
coming into flower.</p>

<p>We were rather late in this morning’s start, and it was near 9
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span> when, after the tents and luggage
were packed, we got under way, accompanied by our host of last
night, the Governor’s son, who volunteered to show us his father’s
garden, of which he was evidently proud. We rode down the hill, and
soon reached a place called the ‘Tuesday Market’ (Souk el Tleta),
beside which we were to inspect the first example we met of Moorish
horticulture. The enclosed space, about an acre in extent, was
divided into oblong beds, in which the only cultivated flowers were
roses and marigolds, growing amidst an abundant growth of weeds.
Along with these we noticed several beds of mint, which is in
constant requisition for mixing with green tea.</p>

<p>At the open space of the ‘Tuesday Market,’ our host took leave
of us. We had not thought it necessary to make him a present, but
he had no hesitation in asking for such small articles as caught
his fancy. Maw had beguiled the tedious hour of waiting for dinner
last night by exhibiting the combustion of magnesium wire, and
complied with a request to that effect by giving up a small portion
of his store. The Moor had spied a small lens in the hands of
Crump, Hooker’s servant, and now asked for that. He next begged for
some trifling European article belonging to Abraham, our
interpreter, and finally for a box of fusees, the last possessed by
Ball.</p>

<p>In a country where shops are unknown, except in a few large
towns, the only chance for obtaining anything which the peasant
cannot raise on his own ground is at the nearest market. These are
held at some selected spot throughout<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_106">[106]</span> the inhabited parts of the country, not
always near a village, and the place takes its name from the day of
the week on which the market is held. We found this place to be
1,183 feet (360·3 m.) above the sea level.</p>

<p>Our way now lay for some distance amidst enclosed and cultivated
land, through green lanes bordered by shrubs covered with climbing
plants. As the enclosures came to an end, and we again found
ourselves in an open country dotted with trees, we observed the
Argan gradually becoming more scarce, and the <i>Zizyphus</i> more
frequent, until the last of the former were seen about ten miles
east of the <i>kasbah</i>. Among the smaller shrubs <i>Rhus
pentaphylla</i> was prominent. The genus <i>Teucrium</i> is
especially characteristic of South Marocco, as may be inferred from
the fact that four new species were found by M. Balansa, besides
many of those common about the Mediterranean. We here met one of
the peculiar Marocco species (<i>T. collinum</i>); and the ever
varying <i>T. Polium</i> constantly recurred throughout our
journey, from the coast up to over 4,000 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>After several brief halts, requisite for collecting new and rare
plants by the way, we rested for half an hour in a shady spot near
a well. Up to this point our course since morning had varied
between due E. and SSE.; but for the remainder of this day’s
journey our general direction was about ENE. The track slowly wound
its way upwards amongst hills covered with <i>Retam</i>, till it
reached the brow of a rounded eminence that overlooks a wide
expanse of treeless plain extending eastward to the horizon, except
where some low flat-topped hills were seen in the dim distance. We
had now accomplished the first stage of our journey. We had
traversed the zone of hilly country lying between the coast and the
great plain of Marocco, on the verge of which we here stood.
Leaving out of account a few prominences to be spoken of hereafter,
the plain appears to the eye quite horizontal; but in fact there is
a very perceptible inclination of about forty feet<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> per mile from south to north,
as it slopes from the foot of the Great Atlas towards the river
Tensift, and a further slighter dip of about ten feet per mile from
east to west, between the city of Marocco and Sheshaoua. The
deficiency of water at once explains the great change in the
vegetation, which was speedily perceptible in detail, but obvious
to the eye from the first view of the country newly opened before
us. Corresponding to this is a considerable change of climate,
arising from the rapid heating of the surface by day, and the no
less rapid cooling by radiation at night. We are already far from
the equable climate of Mogador; and although the air in the shade
is only pleasantly warm, we are happy to have the protection of
pith helmets covered by turbans between our heads and the direct
rays of the sun.</p>

<p>The verge of the great plain over which we rode this afternoon
is far less barren than the portion which yet lay before us; and we
found several species characteristic of similar situations in Spain
and Africa, along with some others, hitherto undescribed, that
appear to be characteristic of this part of Marocco. Thus
<i>Artemisia Herba alba</i> became conspicuous, in some places
almost covering the surface. Of the more noticeable herbaceous
plants here seen were <i>Matthiola parviflora</i>, <i>Gypsophila
compressa</i>, <i>Ebenus pinnata</i> (rather common throughout the
low country), <i>Onobrychis crista galli</i>, an
<i>Elæoselinum</i>, near to <i>E. meoides</i>, and numerous
<i>Compositæ</i>, of which <i>Cladanthus arabicus</i> is one of the
most conspicuous. We did not notice the fragrant odour which some
travellers have found in the flowers of this species. To the same
natural Order belong several undescribed plants, which became more
abundant as we advanced into the interior of the country, belonging
to the genera <i>Anacyclus</i>, <i>Matricaria</i>, <i>Anthemis</i>,
and <i>Centaurea</i>.</p>

<p>About half-past four we reached our appointed camping place, at
Aïn Oumast, one of the few wells of drinkable water found in the
region we had now entered. In the coast<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_108">[108]</span> zone it would appear that in ordinary years
the rainfall is sufficient to enable the natives to raise grain
crops wherever the soil is suitable for the purpose; but in the
interior, cultivation is limited to the tracts that are capable of
irrigation from the streams descending from the Great Atlas, or
else to the immediate neighbourhood of wells. The ground around Aïn
Oumast had borne a scanty crop of grain, and the rough surface, now
baked hard by the sun, was not very comfortable for sleeping upon,
even with the intervention of a mattress of cork shavings.</p>

<p>For a short way before our arrival, the main chain of the Great
Atlas had for the first time been in view, dimly apparent at a
distance of some sixty miles; but as the sun declined towards the
horizon, the outlines became clearer, and we naturally watched with
increasing interest every feature of that mysterious range seen,
even from a distance, by few civilised men, whose recesses we hoped
to be the first to explore. We discussed eagerly the question
whether some patches of lighter colour represented snow, or merely
surfaces of whitish limestone rock; and, as usual, the only effect
of discussion was to confirm each in the impression first formed,
which it was impossible to verify or disprove unless, by viewing
the range from the same direction under similar conditions at a
later season, we could discover whether the appearances in question
should have altered or disappeared.</p>

<p>The <i>mona</i> presented by the Kaïd or sheik of the place was
naturally less profuse than that offered at Shedma, but yet
abundant for the needs of our camp. As almost everywhere, save in
the remoter valleys of the Atlas, green tea and a quantity of white
sugar formed a main feature in the entertainment, and doubtless the
most expensive to the poor people who had to provide it.</p>

<p>The day had been warm, though not oppressive, the thermometer
probably standing at about 80° Fahr. in the shade, and the fall of
temperature during the night was very sensible. Even after the sun
had risen on May 1—<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_109">[109]</span>soon after five <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span>—the thermometer marked only 54° Fahr., but by six
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span> it reached 67°. The observation for
altitude gave 1,132 feet (345·5 m.) above the sea; probably too low
by fifty or sixty feet, owing to the local effect of radiation in
depressing the temperature of the air in contact with the
surface.</p>

<p>We were on our way soon after six; and, on leaving behind the
bushes and small trees that grow on the skirts of the irrigated
ground, we entered on a wide bare plain, stretching unbroken as far
as the eye can reach, which forms the most singular feature in the
aspect of this part of Marocco. The surface is covered with
calcareous rough gravel, mixed in places with siliceous
concretions. The scanty vegetation was already nearly all dried up,
and it was not without difficulty that we secured specimens of most
of the few species that can endure the parching heat and drought.
Conspicuous among these was <i>Peganum Harmala</i>, forming at
intervals green patches amid the general barrenness. <i>Stipa
tortilis</i> was frequent, but mostly dried up, and here and there
occurred tufts of a meagre variety of <i>Avena barbata</i>. More
interesting than these were a diminutive annual species of
<i>Echium</i> (<i>E. modestum</i>, Ball) and two species of
<i>Centaurea</i>—one hitherto known as <i>Rhaponticum acaule</i> of
Decandolle, the other, before undescribed (<i>C. maroccana</i>,
Ball). In its general aspect, and in the character of its
vegetation, this region bears a striking likeness to the stony
portions of the Sahara, and we were not sorry to include this among
our Marocco experiences, though well pleased that the acquaintance
was not to be much prolonged.</p>

<p>Some six or seven miles east of Aïn Oumast we passed a short way
north of Sidi Moktar, the tomb of a saint much venerated in this
region, and the last spot where for a long distance water is to be
found at all seasons. This is one of the halting-places, called
<i>Nzelas</i>, frequented by ordinary travellers who follow this
road. The <i>Nzela</i> is one of the peculiar institutions of this
country deserving of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_110">[110]</span> some notice. The Marocco Government
recognises, at least in theory, the duty of protecting travellers
from violence to their persons and goods; for without some
provision for the purpose the small amount of trade now existing
between the interior and the coast could scarcely continue to
exist. As well as all other executive functions, the sovereign
commits this to the Governor of each province, who accordingly
stations a few armed men at the places where travellers are
accustomed to halt. Such a post is a <i>Nzela</i>. It does not
imply the existence of any shelter, and still less of any supplies
for the sustenance of men and cattle. In a country where the sparse
population lives in tents or temporary sheds, the traveller must
provide such things for himself; but at a <i>Nzela</i> the wayfarer
may count on security from violence, and the guards are entitled to
a trifling payment for each beast of burden that is committed to
their protection. From any demands of this nature, as well as from
the tolls that are levied on passing from one province to another,
we were declared by our escort to be free, as personages travelling
under the direct authority and protection of the Sultan. The
boundaries of the three provinces of Shedma, Mtouga, and Ouled bou
Sba met at Sidi Moktar; but such places in Marocco are proverbially
unsafe, because they are the frequent resort of robbers and
outlaws. In case of a robbery or murder being committed, the people
of each tribe throw the blame upon their neighbours, and the men of
one province are very shy of attempting to pursue malefactors who
take refuge within the boundaries of another. After the commission
of many outrages at this place, it was found necessary to transfer
a portion of territory to the Ouled bou Sba, at the same time
making the Governor of that province and tribe responsible for the
safety of those whom business or piety lead to the sanctuary of
Sidi Moktar.</p>

<p>As we rode onward the Great Atlas chain remained in view, but
dimly seen through the haze that increased with<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span> the increasing heat of the
day, and ahead of us rose some flat-topped hills of singular aspect
which have attracted the attention of all travellers in this
region. Some of these hills extend for a considerable distance,
while others form small isolated masses; but they agree in two
respects—all are flat-topped, and all show a steep escarpment
especially on their westward faces. We afterwards saw reason to
believe that they all rise about 450 feet above the portion of the
plain near at hand, and reach nearly the same height as the plain
surrounding the city of Marocco. The general appearance suggested
the probability of a former wide extension westward of the latter
plain, and subsequent erosion by marine or fluviatile action. As we
approached the most conspicuous of these isolated hills, we were
struck with the singular appearance of the stunted bushes of
<i>Zizyphus Lotus</i>, which form the only arborescent vegetation
of this region. From a little distance they looked as if covered by
some white-flowered climbing plant, or else laden with white fruit.
This appearance was due to the extraordinary number of two species
of snails (<i>Helix lactea</i> and <i>H. explanata</i>) that
completely covered the branches. We frequently noticed the same
appearance afterwards, but nowhere so markedly as here.</p>

<p>Towards the foot of the first and most conspicuous of the hills
above mentioned, which bears the inappropriate name Hank el Gemmel
(Camel’s back), the plain rises gently rather more than one hundred
feet in all; above this the slope of the hill becomes steep, and
finally exhibits an almost vertical face at the top. At the foot of
the steeper slope, about four hours’ ride from Aïn Oumast, our
track passed by an ancient well, now almost dry, and often
completely so; and here, under the imperfect shade of a lotus tree,
we made a short halt. The direct rays of the sun being very
powerful, we were somewhat surprised to find the temperature of the
air to be only 77° Fahr. Leaving our escort, we ascended the low
but steep hill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
above the well. The scarped face exhibited a section of the
yellowish-white limestone that appears to underlie nearly the whole
of the low country between the coast and the base of the Atlas. No
fossils were found; and in the present state of our knowledge, or
rather ignorance, of the whole region, it seems impossible to fix
its position in the geological series. The level summit is capped
by a thin layer of coarse chalcedony, in which we recognised the
origin of the siliceous fragments scattered over the plain below.
This layer would offer resistance to superficial denudation, and
account for the tabular forms of the hills, but where these were
attacked from below by marine or river action the covering would
necessarily be broken up and the fragments scattered over the plain
below. With reference to the opinion expressed by Maw in his paper
in the Proceedings of the Geological Society, and in the Appendix
to this volume, as to the origin of the tufaceous coating of the
plain between Aïn Oumast and Marocco, the only difficulty that
presents itself arises from the presence of these siliceous
fragments on the surface along with the disintegrated tufa. If, as
he and other geologists believe, such a superficial coating is due
to evaporation from the underlying mass of water charged with
carbonate of lime, it seems hard to account for the diffusion of
the chalcedony fragments, unless we suppose a submergence of the
plain subsequent to the formation of the tufa layer, and a renewed
supply of such fragments by further erosion of the hills that
formed the sea or river coast line. To confirm this conjecture, we
may note the fact that the fragments of chalcedony became
progressively rarer as we advanced from the lower portion of the
plain over which we this day travelled to the upper level
surrounding the city of Marocco.</p>

<p>The summit of the hill was found to be 1,648 feet (502·4 m.)
above the sea and 303 feet above the well at its base. It was
barren, yet supplied a few additional plants to our collection.
<i>Frankenia revoluta</i> was abundant, as<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_113">[113]</span> was also a lavender somewhat intermediate
in appearance between <i>Lavandula multifida</i> of the Southern
Mediterranean shores and <i>L. abrotanoides</i> of the Canary
Islands. We also found a form of <i>Cotyledon hispanica</i> of
Linnæus (<i>Pistorinia hispanica</i> of Decandolle), with pale
yellow flowers, intermediate in some respects between the common
plant of Southern Spain and <i>P. Salzmanniana</i> of Boissier and
Reuter.</p>

<p>Resuming our journey, we bore somewhat south of east over a
country similar in character to that traversed in the forenoon, but
not showing such a complete dead level surface. On the way we
noticed for the first time <i>Cucumis Colocynthis</i>, one of the
characteristic plants of the desert region, extending from Arabia
and Southern Palestine across the entire of Northern Africa, but
rarely approaching the littoral zone. Here, as near Suez and
elsewhere, so far as we have observed, this plant is curiously
infrequent. Growing as it does in a region where it has few rivals
to contend with, and the surface is remarkably uniform, one yet
finds but one or two individuals scattered at comparatively wide
intervals over the stony plain. The fruits are used in Marocco to
preserve woollen clothing from moths, but their purgative qualities
do not seem to be known to the native doctors.</p>

<p>Here and there in this part of our route we encountered small
blocks of volcanic rock—trap or basalt—as to the origin of which we
have no information. We have no grounds for supposing eruptive
action to have occurred in this region within a period so recent as
that subsequent to the formation of the tufa which covers the whole
surface of the lower country, and it is not easy to account for the
transport of these blocks from a distance after its formation.</p>

<p>The direct heat of the sun was great in the afternoon, and the
way barren and monotonous, so that it was with thorough
satisfaction that, on reaching the summit of a slight swelling rise
on the plain, at near 5 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, we
saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span> before us a
green shallow basin, at the farther end of which our eyes rested
gladly on the abundant foliage of gardens and orchards. A stream
from the Great Atlas, diverted into numerous slender irrigation
channels, is the source of this apparent fertility, but so much of
the water is taken up in this way that only a trifling surplus
remains; and, save after heavy rains, it seems that a mere
streamlet flows northward to join the Oued Tensift, the chief river
of South-western Marocco. The green that gladdened our eyes seemed
to have given but deceptive promise, for we at first entered on a
scrub formed exclusively of Chenopodicaeous bushes, including
<i>Arthrocnemum fruticosum</i>, <i>Caroxylon articulatum</i>,
<i>Suæda fruticosa</i>, and <i>Atriplex Halimus</i>.</p>

<p>The same thing happens here that may be noticed in the
neighbourhood of the freshwater canal in the Isthmus of Suez. Where
the soil contains a quantity of soluble salts, the first effect of
admitting moisture by irrigation is to form a salt marsh, which
becomes covered with its own characteristic vegetation; but if the
surface is so disposed as to allow the percolation of fresh water,
the salts are gradually carried off, the salt marsh is converted
into fertile land, and the ugly <i>Chenopodiaceæ</i> disappear.
Accordingly, after traversing a broad belt of scrub, we soon found
ourselves amidst luxuriant vegetation, and saw our tents, which had
preceded us, pitched under the shade of tall fig-trees, in one of
the orchards belonging to the village of Sheshaoua. This place is a
true oasis, and an abundant growth of fig, olive, pomegranate,
apple, plum, and apricot, with an undergrowth of grasses and
herbaceous plants, affords a striking contrast to the desert tracts
surrounding it.</p>

<p>The vegetation of the irrigated land, excepting a few tall
palms, was almost exclusively European; and not without pleasure we
gathered many common English species, such as our common bramble,
dandelion, charlock, <i>Sisymbrium Irio</i>, <i>Geranium
dissectum</i>, <i>Hypochæris<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_115">[115]</span> radicata</i>, <i>Sonchus oleraceus</i>,
<i>Lycopus europæus</i>, <i>Plantago major</i>, <i>Rumex
pulcher</i>, <i>Carex divisa</i>, and <i>Scirpus
Holoschænus</i>.</p>

<p>The usual <i>mona</i> was sent soon after our arrival; and the
local governor, a deputy of the Governor of Marocco, paid a visit
of ceremony in the evening. He was a black of nearly pure Negro
type, and in all probability originally a slave. We were not then
familiar with the fact that slaves frequently rise in Marocco to
the highest posts in the State. The body-guard of the Sultan is
exclusively recruited among the black population, either voluntary
immigrants, or slaves imported young from Timbuctoo. These form the
only troops in the country that can be relied on to repress
internal disorder, though in case of war with a European Power
there is little doubt that the whole Moorish population would
respond to an appeal to their patriotism and fanaticism. Whether
the same would hold good as to the Bereber tribes of the Great and
Lesser Atlas may be much doubted. With these the sentiment of
national, or rather tribal, independence is the predominant
feeling, and so long as an invader kept aloof from their native
valleys they could not be easily moved to action. It naturally
happens that an absolute ruler, too conscious of his slight claim
on the affections of his own people, is led to prefer men whose
prominent virtue is that of the dog—attachment and fidelity to him
who feeds them. When it is considered that, in addition, the Negro
often possesses far more energy than the Moor, united to at least
equal natural intelligence, it may be believed that the rulers of
Marocco have shown no want of policy in favouring this section of
the population.</p>

<p>The thermometer about sunset stood at 72° Fahr., while in the
water flowing beside our camp it marked but 62°. At 1 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span>, when we had concluded our nightly task in laying
out our plants, it had fallen to 52°, and rose only to 57° an hour
after sunrise, when the barometer was recorded, and gave an
estimated altitude of 1,141 feet<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_116">[116]</span> (347·8 m.), or almost exactly the same as
that of Aïn Oumast. The coolness of night temperature throughout
this region of Northern Africa doubtless contributes to make the
climate not only healthy but favourable to human activity; and it
was impossible for us not to speculate at times on a possible,
though remote, future, when this may become the home of a
prosperous and progressive community.</p>

<p>Early rising does not always mean an early start, and many
delays occurred on the morning of May 2, before our caravan was
fairly under way at about 9 o’clock. On leaving our encampment, we
perceived, on rising ground close at hand, the remains of an
ancient town, with stone houses, for the most part in ruins, but
some of them still inhabited, and a <i>kasbah</i> or castle of
somewhat imposing appearance. We failed to obtain any information
as to these buildings, which may probably be of considerable
antiquity. It must be remembered that throughout the portion of
Marocco inhabited by an Arab population permanent houses are
unknown, excepting in the coast towns and the royal cities of
Marocco, Fez, and Mekines. The country people live in
<i>douars</i>, which are merely groups of rude dwellings, half
hovel half tent, usually formed of branches, over which a piece of
camel’s hair cloth is stretched, and leaving no wreck behind when
choice or necessity leads their inhabitants to remove from one spot
to another. Even the Governor’s <i>kasbah</i>, though often a pile
of large dimensions, rarely survives a single generation. The great
wall and massive towers surrounding it, as well as the building
itself, are constructed of unbaked bricks or of blocks of mud half
dried in the sun; and save in cases where a son succeeds his father
in power, the custom of the country is to level the whole structure
to the ground on the death or removal of the occupant. A few
seasons complete the work, and nothing remains but a few mounds of
clay to mark the site. Thus it happens that in a country of which
the greater part is naturally<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_117">[117]</span> fertile, the stranger may travel long
distances without perceiving a trace of human habitations, or any
other buildings than the <i>zaouias</i> and <i>koubbas</i>, which
are scattered over the country at unequal intervals. By these names
are designated the tombs of persons, who, when alive, attained a
reputation for sanctity, differing only in the rank which they hold
in local estimation. The person over whose remains a <i>zaouia</i>
is constructed may be regarded as the patron saint of the tribe or
province, while the <i>koubba</i> marks the resting-place of a
saint of less renown.</p>

<p>We soon left behind us the irrigated ground, and entered on a
barren region, less absolutely sterile than that of the preceding
day’s journey, and having a more varied vegetation. Blocks of black
volcanic rock were more frequent, and of larger size, indicating
that we were nearer to the place of their origin, wherever that may
be. In some spots <i>Artemisia Herba alba</i> was the predominant
plant, but we met several new species not before seen. One of the
most curious of these is a white-flowered <i>Picris</i> (<i>P.
albida</i>), afterwards seen at intervals in the low country, whose
ligules wither so rapidly that we failed to secure any satisfactory
specimens. Without becoming hilly, the surface lay in slight
heaving undulations, the upward slope being always longest towards
the east; and the same remark applied throughout the day’s ride. In
about three hours we reached Aïn Beida, where a copious spring of
excellent water fertilises a tract of about a square mile. We
turned aside from our track to halt beneath a very fine pistachio
tree,<a id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> fully forty feet high and two feet in diameter.
The sun was very hot, though the temperature of the air was not
more than 80° Fahr., and we were assured that our halting place for
the night was only four hours’ distant; and so it happened that
between luncheon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
and rest, and short excursions into the blazing sunshine to
botanise in the surrounding corn-fields, we did not resume our
journey until 3.20 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> The baggage train
as usual had gone on ahead; and as the evening light was fading
fast, about 7.20 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, when we expected to
be near our night quarters, some inquiry from our escort revealed
two disagreeable facts: first, that we were still nearly two hours’
ride from Misra ben Kara; and secondly, that the baggage train had
taken a different road. It is not surprising that such intelligence
coming suddenly on three hungry and tired Englishmen, with the
further prospect of passing the night without food or shelter, led
to a vehement row, in which strong, if not intelligible language
was discharged at the head of the worthy Kaïd El Hadj, the
commander of our escort. The whole affair had probably arisen from
some misunderstanding; but it was settled by sending two of the
escort to ride at full gallop after the missing baggage train,
while we jogged on sad and silent towards our destined quarters for
the night. Being pressed for time, we had abstained from botanising
by the way from Aïn Beida; but at one place we stopped to gather
some extraordinarily fine specimens of <i>Phelipæa lutea</i>, which
caught our eyes in the failing light. This is the king of the
broomrape tribe; the stems stood four or five feet high, with
sceptre-like spikes of large yellow flowers, nearly two feet long,
but it was quite too dark to ascertain on what plant this curious
parasite had attached itself.</p>

<p>The stars shone down with marvellous brilliancy on the desolate
tract over which we rode in single file, always ascending slightly,
and the chain of the Great Atlas stood out more definitely than we
had yet seen it, when, at past 9 o’clock we reached Misra ben Kara,
and found to our relief that the baggage train had just preceded
us. About 11 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> some food was prepared,
and, being fairly tired, we soon lay down for the night after a
frugal meal. But not to sleep, for the furious barking of the dogs
from the adjoining village, or <i>douar</i>, and the clatter kept
up by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> our own
people, did not let us close our eyes till the night was far
spent.</p>

<p>On this, as on many another occasion, we were forced to admire
the extraordinary endurance of the common people of this country.
It was not mainly the amount of work they are able to accomplish,
but their high spirits and cheerful demeanour under hardships and
difficulties. Four of our men travelled on foot, walking or running
at a jog trot under a burning sun, and on arrival in camp the same
men were always ready for work in setting up tents, moving heavy
luggage, and attending to the various wants of their employers.
Having often to wait till midnight for their food, they would pass
the time in lively talk, and after the stimulus of a draught of
green tea, their renewed spirits generally broke out in the form of
songs or chaunts that seemed interminable. Then, after three or
four hours’ sleep, they were ready to begin again next morning with
the same unflagging energy and spirit. During the day the men on
foot resorted to a curious expedient for diminishing the effect of
heat, by thrusting a stick down the back between the skin and their
scanty woollen garment, and thus securing ventilation.</p>

<p>We were up soon after daybreak on May 3. Our camp was close to
the wretched village of Misra ben Kara, a large collection of mere
hovels put together with mud and dried branches, and enclosed, as
the <i>douar</i> generally is, within a sort of rampart formed of
the dried stems and branches of the <i>Zizyphus Lotus</i>, piled up
to a height of eight or ten feet, through which a single opening
gives admission to the inhabitants and their domestic animals. It
stands at a short distance from the Oued Nyfs,<a id=
"FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> the chief
streams flowing northward from the Great Atlas. We started about 7
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span>, and soon reached the banks, fringed
with magnificent oleanders in full flower, below which the shallow
stream runs in a deep bed. Like all the rivers of this country,
this is liable to great oscillations; and though it seemed nowhere
two feet deep when we crossed it, travellers are said to be
sometimes detained for days, owing to the impossibility of fording
the stream in rainy weather.</p>

<p>We found here a few plants not hitherto seen, but were
especially pleased with an undescribed <i>Statice</i> (<i>S.
ornata</i>, Ball), not found elsewhere on our journey, whose
numerous bright amethyst blue flowers were scattered on long,
slender, much-branched panicles.</p>

<p>On the east side of the river we fairly entered on the portion
of the great plain immediately surrounding the city of Marocco,
extending some thirty miles from west to east, and southward to the
base of the Great Atlas. This is inclined upwards from west to
east, and still more decidedly from north to south; but to the eye
it appears a dead level, and the hills represented on Beaudouin’s
map as approaching near to the city on the south and east have no
existence in fact. The north-western border of the plain is, on the
other hand, marked by prominent rough hills of a ruddy hue, as seen
from a distance, which rose on our left as we advanced towards the
city.</p>

<p>Some portion of these hills, seeming to form an interrupted
range, extending along the north side of the Oued Tensift and
parallel to its course, was traversed by Washington on his route
from Azemor to Marocco in December, 1829. He estimates their height
above the plain at from 500 to 1,200 feet, and describes the rock
as schistose, with veins of quartz, the line of strike from north
by east to south by west, and the dip 75°. To us it appeared that
the higher summits, which perhaps do not lie near Washington’s
track, must rise fully 2,000 feet above the plain. On the southern
side of the Oued Tensift, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_121">[121]</span> nearer to the city, are some lower hills,
very similar in appearance to the others, and probably of similar
geological structure. One of these, visited by Maw, is described as
formed of very hard, dark, grey rock, with knotted white
concretions elongated in the line of stratification, the strike
from north-west to south-east, and the dip south-west, varying from
50° to 80°.</p>

<p>Our attention, commonly fixed on the vegetation of the country,
was on this day chiefly engaged by the great range of mountains, no
longer very distant, that bounded the horizon to the south. We had
expected to find no difficulty in singling out the peak of Miltsin,
described by Washington in the first volume of the Journal of the
Royal Geographical Society, as the highest peak of the Atlas
visible from the city of Marocco, and the altitude of which, as
determined by a rough trigonometrical measurement, he fixes at
11,400 English feet. Approaching the city by a very different route
from that of Washington, we soon convinced ourselves that there is
no summit visible in the main range much surpassing its rivals in
height, and we subsequently came to the conclusion, that Miltsin,
which appears somewhat higher than its neighbours in the view from
the city, is situated somewhat on the north side of the watershed,
and therefore nearer to the observer than any other lofty summit of
the range. It may fairly be inferred from Washington’s account that
he had no opportunity for measuring a base-line—such as could allow
him to determine accurately the height of distant summits. The
conclusion to which we now came, and which was confirmed by our
subsequent observations, was that the part of the main range within
sight of Marocco and its neighbourhood is remarkably uniform in
height. There are many prominent points that probably approach the
limit of 13,500 English feet, and no depressions that fall more
than about 2,000 feet below that height, This, as will be seen
hereafter, does not apply to the westerly part of the chain lying
west of the sources<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
of the Oued Nyfs, but this is only imperfectly seen from the
neighbourhood of Marocco.</p>

<p>The day was hotter than any we had yet experienced, the
temperature in the shade being about 85° Fahr., and the breeze
which usually rises during the hottest hours was scarcely felt. But
the vicinity of lofty mountains usually determines strong currents
in the heated air, and these must have been at work, though unfelt
by us. As we looked towards the mountain chain, we noticed lofty
columns of sand or dust, remarkably uniform in shape, that
travelled steadily westward across the plain in the opposite
direction to the breeze, so far as this could be detected. At one
time as many as three of these were seen at the same time, each
moving independently. These miniature cyclones, arising from the
interference of opposite currents of air, are not uncommon in the
plains on the south side of the Alps, but are rarely to be seen on
so great a scale as here.</p>

<p>About two hours after starting, the great tower of the chief
mosque came into view, and one of our soldiers rode on ahead to
announce our approach. Not long afterwards we met a courier bound
for Mogador with letters for Mr. Carstensen, and we took the
opportunity of reporting progress and sending him a few details as
to our journey. In default of regular postal communication, which
is not to be thought of in such a country, the facility for
forwarding letters in Marocco is far greater than could be
expected. For a few shillings a native is easily induced to make a
journey of many days, and take care of letters, which always reach
their destination. The reverence with which Mohammedan people
generally regard all written communications—which may perchance
contain the name of Allah—serves as a protection so effectual, that
the loss of letters and despatches is scarcely ever heard of. These
couriers travel forty or even fifty miles a day, and after a day’s
rest are ready to return to the place whence they came. The chief
object of Mr. Carstensen’s letter to Marocco had<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> been to recommend us to the
good offices of some wealthy and influential Moors, correspondents
of English mercantile houses, and we were not long before
experiencing the benefit of this piece of kindly attention.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun was much felt as we rode over the open
plain, and it was suggested that we should do well to halt awhile,
and await the return of the soldier who was to report to us the
state of affairs in the city. The only spot on the way affording
the slightest shelter is under the reclining trunk of a fine tree
of <i>Tamarix articulata</i>, which had apparently been blown down,
though still adhering to the ground by its roots, and throwing out
vigorous shoots and branches. The remaining portion of the trunk
was 24 feet long, and at 8 feet from the roots the girth was 7 feet
7 inches (2·32 m.) We saw no other specimen of this tree,
characteristic of the semi-tropical region of Northern Africa; but
our opportunities for exploring the country surrounding the city
were very limited, and it seems probable that it is here
indigenous, though the extreme scarcity of fuel may have led to its
partial extermination. The slender twigs into which the branches
are divided gave no protection from the sun; but, by throwing a
carpet overhead, we extemporised a serviceable roof, whose shade
was most welcome. Though bare to the eye, this part of the plain
produced many small herbaceous plants, such as <i>Notoceras
canariensis</i>, our native <i>Coronopus Ruellii</i>,
<i>Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum</i>, and <i>Schismus calycinus</i>.
The <i>Mesembryanthemum</i> is as common here as it is in the East;
but the last-named grass, so characteristic of the skirts of the
desert in Egypt and Arabia, seems to be rare in South Marocco.</p>

<p>Throughout our morning’s ride, as well as on the journey between
Sheshaoua and Misra ben Kara, we noticed the apparently
unaccountable way in which certain social species prevail over a
considerable tract, and then suddenly give place to others, without
any apparent reference to the composition of the soil. Where
Chenopodiaceæ,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> such
as <i>Suæda</i> and <i>Caroxylon</i> prevail, it is reasonable to
conjecture the presence of nitre, gypsum, or other salts in the
superficial layer; but such plants as <i>Artemisia Herba alba</i>,
<i>Genista monosperma</i>, and a local form of <i>Helianthemum
virgatum</i> will sometimes take almost exclusive possession of the
surface, though this in some places is mainly composed of siliceous
sand, in others of disintegrated calcareous tufa, and in others of
decomposed volcanic rock, nowhere seen by us <i>in situ</i>, but
derived from scattered blocks of various sizes. In the plain near
the city siliceous sand predominates, and, as a consequence, the
vegetation is more meagre than elsewhere.</p>

<p>We hereabouts first saw the only works of public utility which
we encountered during our journey. What first struck the eye were
long lines of irregular earthen mounds traversing the plain in a
north and south direction, and we soon ascertained that these were
watercourses rudely arched over. The streams from the mountains
south of the city are distributed through irrigation canals over a
large part of the plain, and thus render it fit for cultivation.
Early experience must have taught the people that by protecting
these canals from evaporation, they could be made available to a
much greater extent; and it is probable that the construction of
these covered waterways, some of which were in a ruinous condition,
goes back to a remote period. In point of fact, the whole drainage
of three considerable valleys, whose torrents we afterwards
crossed, appears to be intercepted by this irrigation process, and
absorbed by the vegetation of the plain. It is probable that by the
skilful extension of the same system wide tracts, now barren, might
be made productive.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">After</span> vainly waiting nearly
two hours for the return of our soldier, we determined to push on
towards the city of Marocco, though somewhat uncertain what the
character of our reception might be. This was not merely a matter
affecting our personal comfort during our short stay, but was
certain to have an important effect on the success of our
subsequent journey, and it was a most fortunate circumstance that
Hooker’s long experience in contending with the jealousies and
suspicions of the native authorities in Nepal and the border States
of North-eastern India, and his thorough knowledge of the character
of people, who, though far removed, very much resemble the Moors in
their ideas and maxims of policy, had prepared him to deal with
them successfully. We had gained the first essential condition for
exploring the unknown valleys of the Great Atlas, by obtaining the
consent of the Sultan; but it was impossible to guess the precise
tenor of the orders forwarded by him to the local authorities, and,
whatever these might be, the ultimate result would largely depend
on the good or ill faith of the latter in carrying them into
effect. The person whose favourable dispositions it was chiefly
important to secure was El Graoui, who exercises under the Sultan a
wide authority as Governor of nearly all the tribes of the Great
Atlas that recognise the imperial authority, extending over a
considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
portion of the country at the foot of the mountains inhabited by a
Shelluh population. El Graoui, as we knew, lived in the city of
Marocco, but outside his own jurisdiction. The Governor of the city
and its immediate neighbourhood was Ben Daoud, a man notorious for
his dislike to strangers and especially to Christians, and it was
to him that we had to look for our reception, on our arrival.</p>

<p>From whatever side it be approached the city of Marocco presents
an imposing appearance. The western side presented an outline about
a mile and a half in length. Massive walls, some thirty feet in
height, with square towers at intervals of about 120 yards,
completely enclose it, and on two sides at least it is girdled by a
wide belt of gardens in which the date-palm, olive, and fig are the
most conspicuous trees. Here, as elsewhere, the date-palm
flourishes in a sandy soil where the roots plunge into a more
compact subsoil kept moist by infiltration. On the north-west side
the palm groves, which we passed on our left, are so close and
continuous as to give the effect of a forest, while along our route
they alternated with other cultivated trees. The effect of the
scene as we approached was peculiar and new. The luxuriance of the
vegetation that at intervals screened from view the great range of
the Atlas, the majestic old olive trees, the rough trunks of the
tall palms on which stood many a motionless chameleon; the walls
and towers of the great city seen at intervals as we wound among
the gardens and groves, combined to form a striking and highly
picturesque scene. It was near 4 o’clock when, as we were drawing
near the walls, we were startled by the sudden appearance of a
party of well-mounted Moors in flowing <i>haïks</i>, whose horses
leaped in succession through a gap in an adjoining fence and
advanced to meet us. Our surprise was increased when the foremost
of the party greeted us in English with a friendly welcome. This
gentleman, whose outward appearance was quite
undistinguishable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
from that of his companions, was Mr. Hunot, brother of the British
Vice-Consul at Saffi, and representative at Marocco, of the house
of Messrs. Perry & Co., of Liverpool. His companions, grave and
courteous-looking Moors of considerable local influence, were Sidi
Mohammed Hassanowe <a id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and Sidi Boubikir, with two or three more
of less note. We were invited into an adjoining garden, where
carpets were spread under large olive trees, and a refection in the
Moorish style, consisting of green tea, cakes of wheaten flour and
kabobs, was speedily prepared.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunot had spent several months in the city, and in the
absence of M. Lambert, a French merchant, who has lived there for
many years, was the only European resident. Although his thorough
familiarity with the language, customs, and ideas of the natives
made his position less difficult, he found it practically so
irksome that he was then on the point of returning to Saffi, his
ordinary residence; and we owe it to his kind desire to assist us
during this critical period of our journey that he postponed his
departure for a day. The time passed very pleasantly, and we
listened with satisfaction to the opinion expressed by our hosts
that no obstacles would be interposed to our intended journey in
the Atlas; when the first sign of rocks ahead was disclosed on the
return of the messenger despatched to ascertain what sort of
lodging had been prepared for us. When the messenger acknowledged
that a very small house with but two rooms had been provided, it
became clear that, so far as the city authorities were concerned,
there was no disposition to show us much courtesy. Hooker at once
sent back a message to the Governor, that we should require a much
larger house, or else an enclosed garden in which to pitch our
tents. After about half-an-hour’s delay, the messenger again
appeared, saying that a much larger house, with four<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> rooms, and more adjoining if
required, was ready to receive us. Hereupon we resolved to enter
the city, and in company with our new friends, whose ample
<i>haïks</i> picturesquely draped must have contrasted favourably
with the ugly <i>jellabias</i> that we wore over our European
dress, we defiled in a long cavalcade, followed by the mules,
camels, and donkeys of our train, through the gardens that on this
side approach close to the city walls.</p>

<p>Before the gate we found an officer, evidently of inferior
position, with some ten or twelve ragged fellows on foot, armed
with rusty matchlocks, posted there to receive us, and to conduct
us to our quarters; and with this sorry escort, we made our entry
into Marocco. It is impossible by any language to convey the sense
of utter disappointment and disgust which overpowered us on our
first arrival; and though these feelings soon became subordinate to
others connected with our personal position, they are those which
predominate in our subsequent recollections.</p>

<p>After passing the gateway we had before us a wide road, with a
lofty mud wall on one side and a lower mud wall on the other. The
high wall on the right forms part of the enclosure of the Sultan’s
palace; over that on the left branches of shrubs or trees appeared,
showing that gardens or orchards lay behind. On either side of the
road rose accumulations of refuse and filth that looked as if they
might have been the growth of centuries, and the farther we went
the greater became the piles of abomination, until it seemed as if
these would block up the passage. We had passed a fine Moorish arch
of wide span, that forms the chief entrance to the palace
enclosure, and following this as it makes a sharp turn to the
right, there were still no signs of dwellings. The mud walls on
either side, on which many storks built their nests, were often in
a ruinous state; and here and there it seemed as if people had
burrowed beneath so as to make something between a den and a hovel.
At length we turned into a sort of lane, and soon emerged into what
appears to be one of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> main streets. Hitherto we had met very few
passers-by; but we now found ourselves in a rather crowded
thoroughfare, encountering a good many men on horseback, and a
large number of foot passengers, many of them veiled women. The
street displayed nothing but mud walls, about twenty feet in
height, without a single window, but with openings at frequent
intervals leading into short and narrow passages or lanes. The
behaviour of the people as we passed was singular. Some of them
cast scowling looks at us and muttered words, certainly not of
welcome, which may very likely have included some unflattering
references to our grandmothers; but the great majority went by
without seeming to heed us in the least, as though European
costume, which had probably not been seen within the walls since M.
Beaumier’s visit in February, 1868, were a familiar sight calling
for no remark.</p>

<p>At length the head of our escort turned suddenly into one of the
narrow lanes, barely wide enough to let a laden camel pass; we
followed and, after passing the entrances of five or six other
houses, reached a low door at the end of the lane. Stooping through
the mean entrance and a short passage, we found a small open court,
about fifteen feet square, on each side of which was a narrow room,
receiving no light except from the court. A very brief inspection
showed that the whole place was swarming with insects of every
kind; and as Hooker turned round to express his opinion and his
intentions, it was found that the officer with his rabble escort
had decamped the moment he saw us safe into the house, thinking no
doubt that we had thus no option but to remain there. When Hooker
announced in very decisive terms his resolution not to sleep in
such a house, Mr. Hunot and our new Moorish friends, foreseeing a
row between us and the Governor, urged that we should put up with
the house for that night, and on the following morning negotiate
for a more suitable dwelling. As we were holding council together
as to what should be done, a number of men<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_130">[130]</span> appeared on the scene, each bearing one of
the customary large beehive covered dishes, as a <i>mona</i> for
our evening meal. They were instantly ordered to carry their dishes
back to Ben Daoud, and inform him that we refused to stop in that
house. They said they could not take away the food, as their orders
were to leave it for us; but on the order being repeated in more
imperative tones, they departed, most likely settling the
difficulty by appropriating the <i>mona</i> between themselves and
their friends. At this point Hooker’s knowledge of the Oriental
character was conspicuously shown. If it be often true in the West
that people are taken at their own valuation of themselves, this
becomes an invariable rule among Eastern people. It was absolutely
necessary for our eventual success that it should be understood
that we were persons travelling by the express authority of our own
Government, and entitled to all respect from the officers of the
Moorish Sultan, however high their position might be. Were we to
allow ourselves to be treated as mere private persons recommended
to their good offices, there was an end to all hope of breaking
down the barriers by which national prejudice and ancient tradition
had closed the interior of the country against the intrusion of
strangers. Had we even given way for a single day, the ingenuity of
the natives would have found abundant pretexts for evading our
demands; it was much easier to refuse the proffered lodging at once
than to give a good reason why we could not spend a second night in
a house where we had passed the first.</p>

<p>A messenger was despatched to Ben Daoud. ‘Tell the Governor,’
said Hooker, ‘that my Sultana gives me a large house with a garden
to live in; hospitality would require that the Governor of Marocco
should provide me—the guest of his Sultan—with a better house; but,
in any case, I shall not live in a worse one.’ In a short time the
messenger returned with the answer: ‘The Governor has no better
house to give the Christians;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_131">[131]</span> but Marocco is large, and they are welcome
to provide for themselves!’ It was then immediately decided to camp
out for the night; and the better to mark our sense of the
reception given us, it was at first proposed to pitch our tents
outside the walls. From this, however, we were dissuaded. In such a
position, apparently deprived of the protection of the local
authorities, we should certainly, it was said, be attacked by
robbers, from whom our Mogador escort might not prove a secure
defence. It was finally decided that our best course would be to
encamp in the great open space beside the chief mosque and tower of
the Koutoubia. Our men had been ordered not to unload the baggage,
so we were immediately under way. In the twilight the filth and
abjectness of all that met the eye were not so glaringly prominent
as before; but as we rode through more streets and lanes and open
spaces, we saw no single building of the slightest pretension,
until we entered the great square, at the farther end of which is
the tower of the Koutoubia, the solitary specimen of architecture
of which the ancient capital can boast.</p>

<p>The daylight was fading fast, but enough remained to show that
the spot of our encampment was anything but inviting. Go where we
would the ground was covered with refuse of every kind, full of
scorpion holes, and swarming with insects, of which the most
abundant and unsightly, though the least mischievous, were very
large black Coleoptera, distant relatives of our European
cockroaches, and the whole space was bordered by a ditch or open
drain that reeked with foul exhalations. Meanwhile, we had sent the
captain of our escort with a message to Muley Hassan, the Viceroy,
informing him of our resolution to encamp in our own tents, until a
suitable house had been provided for us. A civil answer was
returned, expressing a wish that we should not camp out, and saying
that he had sent orders to Ben Daoud immediately to provide us a
suitable residence. Soon after came a polite message from
El<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> Graoui,
expressing his regret that we had not been lodged to our
satisfaction, and forwarding a letter that he had addressed to Ben
Daoud on the subject. Nearly an hour passed, when at last a final
answer came from Ben Daoud, saying that it was then too late to
comply with our wishes, but that on the following morning we should
have a good house with a garden.</p>

<p>During all this time we had remained grimly sitting on
horseback, no way anxious, until it should be quite necessary, to
commit ourselves for the night to the unpleasant accompaniments
that surrounded us; but there was no longer any choice, and the
order was given to pitch the large tent and unload the baggage.</p>

<p>During the interval we had been much struck by the demeanour of
the people, who had from time to time passed by as we stood grouped
together in this most public place of the city. Whether in
obedience to orders, or from a spontaneous desire to display their
utter indifference as to the doings of the infidels, no one paid
the slightest attention, or even turned a head to notice us or our
proceedings. Even the very boys engaged in some rough play when we
first arrived on the square showed the same ostentatious
disregard—in striking contrast to the eager curiosity of the Arab
children in Algeria and the East, who will sit for hours together
watching every movement of European travellers. By this time,
however, the night had closed in, and the great square was silent
and dark before our large tent was pitched and the baggage brought
under cover.</p>

<p>Soon after there appeared a train of men bearing dishes—the
evening <i>mona</i>—along with twenty-four soldiers sent by El
Graoui to guard our camp during the night, and about half-past 9 we
were able to get the rather long delayed evening meal and discuss
our further prospects and proceedings. While thus engaged the sound
of angry voices outside the tent interrupted conversation; it was
evident that a violent altercation was going on, in<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> which many voices took part.
When all was again quiet, we ascertained the cause of the row. Ten
soldiers sent by Ben Daoud as a guard for the night had come to
take their places round the camp, when they found the ground
already occupied. El Graoui’s men warned them off, telling them
they had no business there, and when the others insisted on
remaining to carry out their master’s orders the first comers
threatened to thrash them if they did not immediately depart. Peace
was re-established when Ben Daoud’s men retired to the farther end
of the square behind the great mosque.</p>

<p>When we came to talk over the varied experiences of the day, we
first of all agreed that, old travellers as we all were, and
familiar with the squalor of Oriental cities, we none of us had
ever known, or even imagined, the existence of a large town so
expressive of human degradation, so utterly foul and repulsive, as
this wherein we found ourselves. Of all the places commonly visited
by travellers Jerusalem is perhaps that which at the first moment
approaches nearest to the same impression; but, not to speak of the
numerous important buildings and the associations connected with
them, nor yet of the modern structures that have arisen during the
last half-century, the poorest quarters of Jerusalem are far from
rivalling the universal squalor and hideousness of all that meets
the eye in Marocco. A ruinous house, with windows closed by
weather-beaten rickety lattice-work, is not a beautiful object, but
it may be sometimes picturesque, and, at the worst, is far better
than a dead wall of crumbling mud, such as here meets the eye on
every side. It would seem as if the most miserable suburbs of all
the other towns of North Africa and Western Asia had been collected
together and enclosed within a lofty wall, so that seen from
without the whole might be palmed off on mankind as the effigy of a
great city.</p>

<p>On deliberating over the events of the evening in relation to
our own future prospects, we found reason to think<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span> that what had happened did not
necessarily bode ill for the objects of our expedition. A fierce
rivalry, as we knew, already existed between El Graoui and Ben
Daoud, men whose power and influence in the State were supposed to
be of equal weight. Whether to gratify his own feelings, or because
he so understood the intentions of the Sultan, Ben Daoud had showed
himself unfriendly, while El Graoui had clearly declared himself on
our side. But as Ben Daoud had no authority whatever in the Atlas
valleys, his enmity could do us no real harm; while El Graoui,
whose opposition alone was to be feared, might easily be carried
farther than he would have otherwise gone on our behalf for the
mere pleasure of thereby spiting his rival. In this way our visit
came to play a certain part in the interior politics of Marocco,
and the serio-comic development of the story acquires a share of
interest from the light it throws on native character.</p>

<p>Some time after midnight, after finishing our customary task in
laying out our collections of the day, which had been much smaller
than usual, we sallied out to view the surrounding scene. The moon
stood high in the cloudless sky, wherein there was so little vapour
that the stars seemed scarcely dimmed by her brilliancy. The great
tower, stark against the black vault, appeared gigantic in its
proportions as it looked down on the strange scene below. The
noises of the city—even the howling of the dogs—were for the moment
completely stilled; our camels, horses, mules, and asses lay
resting after their day’s work, and amongst them the sleeping
figures of our men, wrapped up in white <i>haïks</i> or
<i>jellabias</i>, looked weird and ghostly in the moonlight. The
distinctness with which we heard the occasional whispers of the
guards around our camp served only to make the deep silence of the
night the more impressive.</p>

<p>On this night the advantages of a tent of what is known as the
Alpine Club pattern, where the floor is made of canvas continuous
with the sides, and the entrance is<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_135">[135]</span> closed by a flap rising about a foot from
the ground, were shown in a striking way. In the great tent, where
the ground underfoot was pierced with scorpion holes and swarming
with insects, Hooker and Maw did not venture to undress, and had to
pass the night perched upon the baggage, while Ball was able to
spread his mattress regardless of the creatures that might be
moving about under the canvas floor. When his tent was struck next
morning the ground underneath was absolutely covered with a
continuous mass of creeping things, yet not a single insect entered
the tent.</p>

<p>When we all rose betimes on the morning of the 4th, we felt that
this must be a decisive day in our contest with the Moorish
authorities. At an early hour Hooker despatched two messengers, one
to the Viceroy, requesting an interview, the other to Mr. Hunot,
begging him to use his local knowledge and influence to make sure
that the request should reach the Viceroy. Soon after arrived a
message from Ben Daoud, saying that we were at liberty to pitch our
tents in an adjoining garden. If that offer had been made on our
first arrival, it is most likely that it would have been accepted;
but, as it was now clear that Ben Daoud was intent on yielding as
little as possible, Hooker wisely resolved to insist on the demand
which he had made on the previous evening, and returned an answer
in nearly the same terms as before.</p>

<p>At 8 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> a morning meal of wheaten
cakes and milk came from El Graoui, and throughout that and the
following days he continued to supply our wants and those of our
followers on the most liberal scale. Besides a light breakfast,
three copious meals with meat and vegetables cooked in the most
approved style, accompanied by dates and oranges, were regularly
furnished; and the addition of a mule-load of oranges that came
later in the day furnished in abundance the most acceptable luxury
that nature affords in this region.</p>

<p>It was clear that the question debated among the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span> Marocco authorities as to the
best way of dealing with the troublesome Christian visitors was
considered a rather knotty one, for fully two hours elapsed before
our Mogador <i>kaïd</i> returned with the Viceroy’s answer. We were
welcome to Marocco, he said, and he had ordered the palace of Ben
Dreis, with the adjoining garden, to be prepared for our reception.
That building belonged, it was added, to his father, the Sultan,
and not to the Governor of Marocco, so that we should consider the
use of it as a mark of the personal favour and friendship of the
Sultan. The request for an interview was evaded, probably to avoid
any further demands that may have been apprehended; but we had
obtained a complete victory, and had nothing more to ask so far as
our stay in Marocco was concerned.</p>

<p>Although the sequel of the story was not unfolded till a day or
two later, it may as well be here given. Si Boubikir, one of our
Moorish friends who had interested himself on our behalf, was sent
for by the Viceroy, and at the same time Ben Daoud was also
summoned. The latter was addressed by the Viceroy in the coarsest
terms: ‘You dog! you slave! you son of a slave! how have you dared
to neglect my father’s orders? Were you not ordered to provide a
suitable residence for these English gentlemen?’ With further
additions of threats and abuse. On the following day (after we had
paid our visit to El Graoui) a person sent by Ben Daoud came to
Abraham, our interpreter, to express a hope that we should also pay
a visit to the Governor of the city in token of reconciliation. He
was to assure us that Ben Daoud was no way to blame for anything
that had happened, as he had acted throughout by the express orders
of the Viceroy, who had desired him to begin by offering the
smaller house, then one somewhat larger, and to leave it to the
Viceroy to meet our demands, if we persisted in asking for a house
with a garden. It was quite impossible to guess how much or how
little truth there might be in this tale, and how far the scene got
up before Si Boubikir was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_137">[137]</span> a mere comedy; but it is characteristic of
the country, that it should not be considered improbable. Hooker
decided that it was not expedient to overlook the affronts of which
Ben Daoud was either the author or the instrument, and his message
was met by a curt refusal.</p>

<p>The house or palace of Ben Dreis, which we were to inhabit,
originally belonged to a powerful minister, whose property, after
the custom of the country, had been confiscated by the sovereign.
In 1864 it was occupied by Sir Moses Montefiore; and a correct
sketch of it is given in Dr. Hodgkin’s narrative of that
gentleman’s mission of benevolence to Marocco.</p>

<p>We were told that a short time would be required to prepare the
house for our reception, and it turned out that the first requisite
step was to knock down the wall that stood where the entrance had
formerly been. A house in which Jews or Christians had lived was
regarded as unclean and unfit for the dwelling of a true believer,
and accordingly after the departure of Sir M. Montefiore, the
entrance had been walled up, and the house had so remained ever
since. When the way had been cleared, an escort of soldiers,
despatched by the Viceroy, accompanied us to our new dwelling,
which stands inside its walled garden very near to the Bab Roub—the
gate by which we yesterday entered the city. We were agreeably
surprised when we approached by far the finest house which we
anywhere saw in this country, a massive square building, entered by
a Moorish arch. As usual, the ground-floor rooms, with the central
court, roofed in, contrary to the usual practice, were fit only for
servants, or for stabling animals and storing goods, and the best
apartments were on the upper floor. These were, of course, destined
for us. But the first glance showed that in a country where animal,
and especially insect, life is so active, the rooms in their
present state would be no pleasant habitations. This, however, was
foreseen and provided for, and, before many minutes were over, a
crowd of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> men,
including our own attendants, were hard at work carrying up large
vessels of water from the irrigation stream in the adjoining
garden, and armed with rough brooms, with which to complete the
work of cleaning the premises. Water was turned on in such
abundance as to stand ankle deep in most of the rooms, and pour in
a copious stream down the staircases and other openings. When all
was done the blazing sun soon dried all up, and during our stay we
suffered no inconvenience, and scarcely saw any insects, except a
few harmless beetles. When the rooms had been thus cleansed and
dried, we proceeded to instal ourselves in our new quarters. There
was a large central room, open to the sky in the middle, with
roofed bays or recesses around, and several adjoining, which served
as bedrooms. The terrace roof, overlooking the trees of our garden
and the city wall, commanded a magnificent view of the Great Atlas
range, and in the early morning, and towards sunset, afforded an
unfailing attraction.</p>

<p>During this and the following days much time was consumed in
long discussions respecting our future plans and arrangements.
During the remainder of his stay in Marocco Mr. Hunot was kind
enough to devote most of his time to us, and in his visits he was
generally accompanied by Si Mohammed Hassanowe and Si Boubikir, who
sat gravely by, rarely taking any part in the conversation. One of
the subjects requiring mature consideration related to the manner
in which the objects of our journey might best be made intelligible
and satisfactory to the Moorish authorities. The matter had already
been under discussion at Mogador and during our journey, but its
importance was now much more obvious when it was clear that our
farther progress would depend on the view that El Graoui might take
of our character and intentions. We were well aware that anything
so simple as the statement that the object was to gratify our
curiosity as to the vegetation of the Great Atlas, would at once be
set aside as a false pretext, intended to cover some sinister
design. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> one
man should be crazy enough to make a long journey for such a
purpose might have been thought within the range of possibility;
but to suppose that three should all at once be smitten with the
same form of insanity was plainly too ridiculous. To endeavour to
explain that Hooker, as Director of a great national establishment
such as Kew Gardens, should be anxious to enrich it by the
introduction of new, rare, or useful plants, was not likely to be
more successful. The existence of any public institution having a
claim to attention apart from the personal will or caprice of the
sovereign could not be made intelligible to the native mind. It was
clear that if we did not present ourselves as persons in some way
carrying out the direct orders of the Queen of England, we should
have no claim to respect, and should be regarded as adventurers
prompted by some motive we did not care to avow.</p>

<p>Of course, we felt a natural reluctance to use the Queen’s name
in an unauthorised way; but, without entering into subtle
discussion as to the extent to which the acts of ministers are to
be regarded as those of the sovereign, the fact that the Foreign
Secretary had, through the Queen’s representative, applied for the
Sultan’s permission for Hooker’s journey, undoubtedly justified him
in assuming a position different from that of an ordinary
traveller. It is true that the knowledge and personal interest
which Her Majesty has always shown in matters relating to Art have
never been publicly displayed in reference to natural history; but
it would certainly not be straining the truth to let it be
understood that such a unique institution as the Royal Gardens at
Kew is regarded by her with sympathy and favour. The most natural
way of conveying this to the Moorish mind seemed to be to say that
the Sultana of England had great gardens, in which were plants from
all the countries in the world, excepting the Great Atlas, and that
she had sent Hooker and his assistants to collect and send home
whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> new plants
they could find there. To this suggestion, a serious objection was
made. It would appear unworthy of a great ruler, we were told, to
trouble herself about anything so frivolous as a garden: ‘Her
thoughts must be engaged in the government of her vast dominions,
and above all in the management of her armies and fleets, and not
on mere matters of amusement.’ ‘But,’ as it was urged, ‘there is
one use of plants that every one can understand. Cannot you say
that you are seeking for herbs useful to cure diseases, and are
charged to bring these home to the Queen of England?’ Of course it
was true that if by any chance such new plants as we might find
possessed medicinal qualities, they would thereby acquire
additional interest, and, therefore, in our numerous subsequent
communications with the authorities, Hooker stated that his
commission was to collect and bring home the plants of the country,
and especially those useful in medicine. It is pretty certain,
however, that the imagination of our interpreter enlarged upon this
text, to what extent we could not of course say. How much that we
afterwards heard was serious, and how much more play of fancy, it
is hard to guess; but there is no doubt that the current belief
among our own followers was that the Sultana of England had heard
that there was somewhere in Marocco a plant that would make her
live for ever, and that she had sent her own <i>hakim</i> to find
it for her. When, in the course of our journey, it was seen that
our botanical pursuits entailed rather severe labour, the
commentary was: ‘The Sultana of England is a severe woman, and she
has threatened to give them stick (the bastinado) if they do not
find the herb she wants!’</p>

<p>It was impossible to decide on our future route until after an
interview with El Graoui; but whatever that might be, it was
certain that we should require a number of animals to convey
ourselves and our baggage; and we yielded to the general opinion of
the country in preferring mules for this purpose. Camels are unfit
for the rough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
mountain paths; and the mule is decidedly superior to the horse in
endurance of prolonged fatigue, inferior food, and vicissitudes of
climate. In a journey of some length it is decidedly economical to
purchase horses and mules rather than hire them; and we resolved to
supply a part of our wants in that way, Mr. Hunot being good enough
to undertake to choose eight mules, for which on the following day
we paid 8<em>l</em>. each.</p>

<p>The current coin in South Marocco we found to be French
five-franc pieces (called by Europeans, dollars) for all except
small transactions. These are carried on by Moorish silver pieces,
worth respectively something less than four pence and two pence,
and little coins of an alloy of copper and zinc, called
<i>flous</i>, of which about fifteen go to an English penny. It was
necessary to provide our interpreter, Abraham, with bags of these
coins to defray the trifling expenses of our journey. It being
understood that the provision of food for our followers and the
animals of our train would be undertaken by the local authorities,
wherever we should go, the only serious expenses we had to provide
for were the purchase or hire of mules, and such gratuities as we
might think proper to distribute amongst our escort and our
servants on our return to Mogador. For presents to governors,
sheiks, and others whom it might be desirable to conciliate or
reward, we had brought with us a supply which turned out to be more
than sufficient for the purpose.</p>

<p>To pass a quiet evening in our own house, free from any
immediate cause for trouble, and with the prospect of a good
night’s rest, such as we had not known since we left Mogador, was
an enjoyment keenly felt; and though our quarters were absolutely
devoid of furniture of any kind, the mere sense of quiet and
freedom from intrusion made them seem to us perfectly luxurious.
The position of our dwelling was indeed admirably chosen.
Completely separated from the inhabited quarters of the city, with
their noises and their stenches, by large gardens and high
walls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> the only
building within our view was the great tower of the Koutoubia. Some
idea of the effect as seen through one of our windows is given in
the accompanying woodcut. It is very similar in design and
dimensions to the Giralda at Seville and the great tower at Rabat,
and like these is said to have been built by Christian captives.
Including the lanthorn at the top, the height is about 270 feet. It
is a singular proof of the deficiency of the Moors in constructive
faculty, that the only stone structures in this, the ancient
capital of the country, once the abode of wealth and barbaric
luxury, should be this tower, and the great arch forming the
entrance to the Sultan’s palace, of which the carved stones were
transported piece by piece from Spain.</p>

<p>The morning of May 5 presented the unusual appearance of heavy
clouds covering the sky and concealing from view the range of the
Great Atlas. This did not last long. The sun soon reasserted his
dominion over the plain, though the clouds still hung round the
higher peaks. The direct heat of the sun was already great at this
season, but the air was always relatively cool. In the shade of our
rooms the thermometer marked about 80° Fahr. during the warmer
hours of the day, and fell to about 70° at night.</p>

<p>It was a matter of some interest to us to study the spontaneous
vegetation of the gardens of Marocco. We could without difficulty
have obtained permission to visit the very extensive gardens that
occupy the larger part of the enclosed space surrounding the palace
of the Sultan; but we decided that we should be able to work more
effectually, and without risk of exciting the suspicions of the
natives, by confining ourselves to the rather large space
surrounding our own dwelling. To the English reader it may be well
to remark that, in Marocco, as in most Eastern countries, a garden
means something very different from what we understand by it at
home. So far as any idea of enjoyment is connected with it the
paramount object is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
shade and coolness. Trees, and running water, without which in this
climate few trees will grow, are therefore the essential
requisites. Beyond this the Moor, if he be rich and luxurious, may
plant a few sweet-scented flowers, of which the rose, violet,
jessamine, and <i>Acacia Farnesiana</i> are most prized; but beyond
this, no mere pleasure of the eye is ever dreamt of, and here, as
elsewhere, there seems to be among the natives a complete want of
the sense of beauty.</p>

</div>

<p>To the Moor the chief object of a garden is not pleasure but
profit. In this admirable climate nearly all the vegetable products
of the temperate and subtropical zones may be had in profusion
wherever water is attainable, and of this the Great Atlas provides
an unfailing supply to the city and its neighbourhood. Even at the
low prices of the country, fruits are the most profitable of all
crops; and it is asserted that the Aguidel Garden—the largest of
those within the palace enclosure—containing about forty English
acres, produces on an average 20,000<em>l</em>. a year.</p>

<p>The fruit-bearing trees planted in our garden were the
date-palm, orange, olive, fig, pomegranate, apricot, almond, pear,
apple, and mulberry, along with a few vines. Besides these were
cypresses, willows (<i>Salix babylonica</i>), aspens,
<i>Robinia</i>, <i>Melia</i>, and <i>Celtis</i>.</p>

<p>There were several tall bushes of <i>Acacia Farnesiana</i>, just
coming into fruit, and of white jessamine. The only cultivated
flowers were the rose, Mirabilis, and hollyhock, and a large-leaved
variety of sweet violet, which has also been found in Madeira. Of
wild arborescent plants we noted only <i>Zizyphus Lotus</i> and
<i>Lonicera biflora</i>; the latter species (peculiar to North
Africa) we observed here and there throughout our journey. Although
the list of wild herbaceous plants includes few that are not common
throughout the Mediterranean region, it may interest some readers
to give it in full. Specimens of nearly all the species enumerated
were preserved by us.</p>

<p>This list affords a fair illustration of the general uniformity
of what may be termed the ruderal vegetation<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_145">[145]</span> throughout the Mediterranean region. Of
81 species enumerated there are but four (<i>Brassica
geniculata</i>, <i>Lonicera biflora</i>, <i>Picris pilosa</i>, and
<i>Leontodon hispidulus</i>) that do not extend to Southern Europe;
fully one-half are found in Northern France and Germany; and 37 are
included in the British flora.</p>

<p>About 4 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> we started by previous
appointment to pay our visit to El Graoui. The usual course in this
country is to make the first visit to a man in authority one of
pure ceremony, wherein presents are made that are intended to
prepare the way for any serious business, which is reserved for a
second interview; but the necessity for deciding without delay on
our future plans, which depended altogether on the consent and
assistance of El Graoui, forbade this dilatory mode of proceeding,
and it was decided that we should go at once thoroughly into the
subject of our intended journey. This was a proud day for our
interpreter, Abraham. While, in spite of some concessions made to
Sir Moses Montefiore, his coreligionists in the city are forced to
put off their shoes when they leave their own enclosure, Abraham,
rejoicing in a pair of gamboge leather boots, could enter with head
erect the presence of the most powerful subject in Marocco.
Preceded by several mounted soldiers, we passed, by the same filthy
roads as before, through the great gate leading to the palace.
Perhaps the sight of a stately procession irritated the feelings of
the people; certainly there was on this occasion no doubt as to the
disposition of the bystanders, made sufficiently clear by muttered
curses and spitting towards us, and even by a few stones thrown in
the same direction, though scarcely intended to reach us.</p>

<p>The walled space which surrounds the dwelling of the sovereign
appeared to be a nearly regular square, of which the sides measure
about half a mile. Besides the residence of the Sultan, rarely
inhabited of late years, and the extensive ranges of mean irregular
buildings used by his attendants and body-guard, another block of
buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> served as
the dwelling of his son, the then Viceroy; and a third group, to
which we proceeded, was the home of El Graoui, who thus avoided the
inconvenience of inhabiting a place subject to the authority of his
rival, Ben Daoud. We saw no building of the slightest architectural
pretensions, or at all comparable to the house in which we
ourselves were lodged. Through narrow tortuous passages, amidst low
buildings, scarcely more than ten feet high, and of the meanest
appearance, we reached a whitewashed building of two floors, and
through a narrow door and passage were ushered up a short flight of
steps into a small room, wherein sat a stout man of completely
black complexion, whose broad countenance gave the impression of
considerable energy with an habitual expression of good-humoured
ferocity. The room was decorated with woodwork, cut into elaborate
geometrical patterns and painted in bright colours, the only form
of decorative art known to the Moors, and lighted by a lanthorn
overhead through small bits of coloured glass. We seated ourselves
on the carpet-covered cushions ranged on either side, and a few of
the ordinary phrases of courtesy, familiar to all readers who have
made a tour in the East, were exchanged. Presently, on a signal
from the great man, the inevitable green tea was served in English
china tea-cups, followed by a slight refection, the air of the room
being meanwhile perfumed with the heavy scent of incense burned
over charcoal.</p>

<p>After this, we, without further preface, commenced conversation
as to the object of our journey, taking care to adhere as nearly as
possible to the line of discourse previously fixed upon. Having in
general terms explained that we wanted to collect the plants of the
high mountains, Hooker was careful to add that we did not care
about stones or minerals. We had been warned that the belief in the
existence of precious metals in the Atlas is traditional in the
country; and though no ruler of Marocco is known to have made any
effort to search<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
for or work mines, extreme jealousy is felt lest strangers should
be attracted by the prospect, and attempt, in consequence, to
establish themselves in the country. In point of fact, we were
obliged to refrain from any overt attempt to collect even the
commonest rocks, and the fragments which we carried away were
picked up and pocketed—as by stealth—when removed from the watchful
eyes of our followers.</p>

<p>El Graoui, with apparent frankness and good-humour, said that he
should have much pleasure in carrying into effect the intentions of
the Sultan in our regard, and that we should have full liberty to
go where we pleased in the portions of the Great Atlas where the
authority of the Sultan is recognised, orders being given that the
local authorities should provide food for us and our followers.
This brought us at once to a question of pressing importance. Up to
this moment we had no notion as to the limits that might be set to
our journey by the Marocco authorities, though too well aware that
Hooker’s engagements in England would not under any circumstances
allow us to carry our explorations very far. In answer to our
inquiries, we were told that we were free to travel on the northern
slope of the mountains that send their waters to the plain of
Marocco. The names of various districts were mentioned, several of
which were strange to our ears, and not to be found on any map; but
we retained those of Glaoui, Ourika, and Reraya, the latter two
being afterwards familiar to us. Further than this, we were
informed that we might travel eastward through the provinces of
Demenet and Ntifa, both apparently high mountain regions, whose
waters run northward to the Oum-er-bia. We were emphatically told
that we must not attempt to cross the chain southward in the
direction of the Sous valley, and we gave a distinct promise to
abstain from doing so. The actual decision as to our future route
was far too important a matter to be disposed of on the spot by men
so imperfectly prepared as we necessarily<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> were, and it was arranged that Hooker
should, in the course of the next day or two, acquaint El Graoui
with the route which we might adopt.</p>

<p>The main point being thus settled, some further conversation
ensued as to the arrangements for our journey. El Graoui informed
us that he would send an escort of five soldiers under the command
of a Kaïd, and further suggested that the escort that had already
accompanied us from Mogador should remain with us throughout the
journey. As it seemed desirable to humour the great man’s fancies,
the latter arrangement was at once agreed to, and in the sequel we
found it decidedly advantageous. The interview was brought to a
close by Hooker presenting to El Graoui a pair of excellent, though
not showy, rifled pistols, which he had brought from England under
the impression that they might be useful for personal defence. We
had an unnecessarily large store of articles intended for
presents—silver watches, musical boxes, opera glasses, cutlery, and
the like; but, on reviewing our stores, Mr. Hunot decided that such
objects would be thought too paltry for a man of El Graoui’s
importance, and that serviceable fire-arms would be far better
suited to his taste.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> returning from our
interview with El Graoui, we felt that our most urgent want was
reliable information about the districts mentioned by him as within
the possible range of our expedition. Hooker had already ordered
Abraham to make inquiry for some one who had actually travelled
eastward from the city into the mountain country; but such a person
was by no means so easily found as a stranger might suppose. The
few Moors who ever go into the interior are cut off from
communication with the natives by ignorance of the language; and,
besides this, the Moor is usually too incurious and intellectually
sluggish to carry away information about anything not directly
concerning his own business or pleasure. Had our stay in Marocco
been prolonged, we might perhaps have been able to collect some
details as to the interior provinces from natives of the mountain
valleys who must from time to time resort to the city; but it is
very doubtful whether a Christian stranger could obtain anything
reliable in this way. People constantly forget how wide the gap is
that separates the mind of a modern European from that of the
inhabitant of a barbarous country, where the conditions of society
are such that apprehension of danger<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_150">[150]</span> to life and property becomes the
predominant feeling. The notion that a man can care to acquire
knowledge of any kind for its own sake is not for a moment
admitted, and suspicion is necessarily the first feeling aroused by
any inquiry, however apparently harmless. Bearing this in mind, we
often felt astonishment at the share of success that has been
attained by some geographers, and especially by Captain Beaudouin,
the author of the French War Office map of Marocco. It is true that
some large portions of that map are quite unreliable, and that it
contains many grave errors as to the direction of the mountain
ranges and valleys; but, considering that the greater part of it
was compiled by the comparison of itineraries and descriptions
furnished by a large number of separate native informants, the
wonderful thing is that in many districts it should approach so
near to accuracy as it does; and it undoubtedly shows a very
remarkable degree of care, patience, and intelligence on the part
of its author.</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, Abraham brought to us an elderly
Jew, named Salomon ben Daoud, described as a man employed by the
merchants trading with the interior, and familiar with all the
roads leading to those parts of South Marocco with which the people
of the city have any intercourse. The contrast between the
appearance of this man and that of the Moors was complete. He had
something of the downcast, long-suffering expression common among
his coreligionists in this country, but an unmistakable air of
intelligence that at once made him interesting. It was easy to
understand that, although despised and often ill-used by the
governing race, these people by their superior brain-power have
contrived to make themselves indispensable to their masters, and
that all people in authority, from the Sultan to the
deputy-governor, are forced to rely upon them. Although Salomon was
able to answer readily most of our questions respecting the several
routes leading from Marocco into the neighbouring portions of the
Great Atlas, it was inevitable<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_151">[151]</span> that the information given by an uneducated
man should fall very far short of what we should have desired; and
the abundant catalogue of names of places—very few of them possible
to be identified on the map—which he glibly enumerated, rather
tended to confuse than to clear up our understanding of the
country. With a view to mature deliberation on a point of such
importance Salomon was requested to write down the chief
particulars which he had given us verbally; and his memorandum,
written in Hebrew, was afterwards translated by Abraham. This
translation, checked by the memoranda taken down at the time by
Ball, is printed in <a href="#apb">Appendix B</a>, and affords a
slight contribution towards the topography of a portion of Marocco
hitherto completely unknown to Europeans.</p>

<p>The morning of Saturday, May 6, found us still in doubt as to
our future course; but, on a careful review of the whole matter, we
adopted a decision of which we saw no subsequent reason to repent.
It appeared that if we decided on pushing forward into the interior
of the country we might be able to reach the head of the valley of
the Tessout—the main western branch of the Oum-er-bia—lying
probably about 120 miles due east of Marocco. The portion of the
Atlas chain whence that stream flows is in all probability as high
as the range seen from the city, and perhaps somewhat higher, and
the district through which we should travel was and still remains a
complete <i>terra incognita</i>, as to which Beaudoin’s map is
almost certainly incorrect.<a id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Against these strong
inducements we had, however, to set many weighty reasons in favour
of the alternative course, which consisted in at once directing our
steps towards the main chain south-east of the city, and thence
travelling gradually towards the Atlantic coast, penetrating in
succession to the head of as many of the chief valleys as
circumstances should allow.</p>

<p>The first course was open to the objection that,
under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span> any
circumstances, it would involve a considerable amount of travelling
through a comparatively uninteresting country—at least four days,
and probably six, for the route to and fro between Marocco and
Demenet, and four days at least for returning to Mogador; and
further, that if difficulties should arise to prevent us from
reaching the head of the Tessout valley, we might possibly miss
altogether the main object of our journey by failing to reach the
higher region of the Great Atlas. On the other hand, by coasting
along the northern skirts of the chain, and penetrating as many
valleys as might be found practicable, we should avoid altogether
the need for retracing any part of our course, and might reasonably
expect to reach a part of the chain whence a couple of days’ ride
would carry us back to Mogador. The strongest argument was,
however, the consideration that by choosing the latter route we
should have numerous chances of accomplishing our desire to reach
the upper part of the mountain range, and that if we should find
impassable obstacles in one or another valley, we should yet have
an unimpaired chance of succeeding elsewhere. Hooker’s strong
impression that our future course would not be unopposed gave
especial weight to the latter view, and the sequel will show that
we were well advised. It was therefore decided to apply to El
Graoui for letters to all the Kaïds of the valleys subject to his
authority in the range extending from Tasseremout to the borders of
Haha, while, with a view to a possible change in our course, he was
also requested to write to the Governor of Demenet.</p>

<p>In one way or other the days passed in Marocco were so fully
occupied as to leave no leisure, and Maw alone was able to afford
time for an excursion to one of the low hills on the south side of
the Oued Tensift, seen on the left of the track by which we had
approached the city. The nearest of these—a rough mass of
metamorphic rock, rising nearly 800 feet above the level of the
plain—is only about three miles distant from the walls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Our regret at
not having been able to accompany Maw on this excursion was much
increased when towards evening he returned with a number of
interesting plants, several of which proved to be additions to the
Marocco flora. The most notable of these was an undescribed species
of the tropical and subtropical genus <i>Boerhavia</i>, and a
curious <i>Reseda</i>, seemingly distinct from any described
species. Besides these, he had gathered a variety of <i>Forskåhlea
tenacissima</i> described by the late Mr. Webb as <i>F.
Cossoniana</i>, <i>Andropogon laniger</i>, a fine grass whose
leaves have the scent of Verbena, <i>Echinops strigosus</i>, and
one or two more species characteristic of the flora of Southern
Algeria.</p>

<p>Maw also visited some of the bazaars, and described them as
miserable and repulsive, and we preferred to let the carpet
merchant who had been recommended to us bring his goods to our
quarters. The carpets made here are not considered equal to those
of Rabat, but they are comparatively cheap and durable. On
inquiring how our purchases could be forwarded to Mogador, we found
that the hire of a camel with his driver for this weary four or
five days’ journey amounted only to about seven shillings of our
money, and that the risk of robbery was considered too trifling to
be worth mentioning.</p>

<p>The comparison of five observations, taken on as many successive
days, gives for the altitude of our station in Marocco a height of
511·9 mètres, or 1,679 English feet. Allowing for the difference of
level, the height of the great square may be taken to be very
closely 500 mètres or 1,640 English feet. The observations were
calculated on the assumption that the barometer at sea level at
Mogador stood at 760 millimètres, and hence it is not surprising
that the results of each day’s observation vary from the mean, in
some cases as much as fifty feet; but, as settled weather prevailed
at this period, the mean adopted is probably very near the truth.
Most of the results of our observations (see Appendix) agree well
with the few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
observations previously made in the interior by M. Beaumier and M.
Balansa; but in this instance there is a difference of seventy
mètres (or 230 English feet), M. Beaumier’s result being 430 mètres
above the sea. No particulars are given by him as to the
instruments used, or the methods of observations and reduction, and
we feel no hesitation in provisionally adopting the height
resulting from our own observations.</p>

<p>As may well be supposed, the object that most fully and
constantly engaged our attention during our stay in Marocco was the
view of the Great Atlas range, for which the terraced roof of our
house afforded every needful facility. The interest attaching to an
almost unknown chain of great mountains was enhanced by the hope of
penetrating its recesses. We were often tantalised by finding
clouds hanging about the flanks, or clinging to the higher peaks,
as happened during the latter days of our stay, but there was
always enough to be seen to reward our attention. We were able to
identify the mountain, Miltsin, which Washington took to be the
highest peak in the Atlas chain visible from Marocco; but we had
already, during the last day’s journey before entering the city,
satisfied ourselves that there is no summit visible from the plain
of Marocco that can claim any marked predominance over its
neighbours. Travelling, as we were, nearly parallel to the main
chain, we were far more favourably placed than Washington, who
approached the city from the NNW., and always viewed the chain from
nearly the same direction. The crest is undoubtedly more sinuous
than it appears as laid down on the map, or when seen from a
distance; some of the projecting summits are therefore nearer to
the eye than others; but it appeared to us then, and our subsequent
experience only strengthened that belief, that most of the peaks or
prominences in the higher portion of the chain seen from the plain
of Marocco, in a distance of fifty or sixty miles, attain to very
nearly the same height.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>Washington
speaks of a base-line of seventeen miles which served him for his
trigonometrical observations, but it is obvious from his narrative
that this cannot have been measured so as to admit of much accuracy
in his results. As a matter of fact, it appears from his map and
accompanying section, and from the narrative of his excursion to
Tagherain, that Washington considerably underrated the distance
from the city to the crest of the Great Atlas. His Miltsin is
doubtless a summit near the head of the Ourika valley, which
apparently stands some short way north of the axis of the chain.
According to the scale of his map Miltsin is twenty-seven and a
half geographical miles distant from the house which he occupied,
whereas it is impossible to estimate the true distance at less than
thirty-three geographical miles. If we allow for the height of
Marocco above the sea level, and increase the estimated height of
Miltsin in the ratio of its true distance to that assumed by
Washington, we get for the height of the peak 13,352 feet (4,069·6
m.) above the sea, which is perhaps somewhat above the true
measurement.</p>

<p>Owing to the prevalence of clouds during the latter period of
our stay in Marocco, we failed to secure a satisfactory outline of
the Atlas chain; but, through the kindness of Sir J. D. Hay, we are
enabled to insert a copy of a drawing made by the late Mr. William
Prinsep, who accompanied the mission to Marocco in December, 1829.
The view of the same range given in Jackson’s generally accurate
work must have been done from description or from imperfect
recollection, as it bears no resemblance to nature.</p>

<p>We had been many times struck by the demeanour of the wild birds
during our journey from Mogador. They seem in this country to be
quite free from what we look on as the instinctive fear of man,
which in truth is an inherited tendency only in those countries
where the human population habitually pursues them. As we rode
along, the turtle doves, which abound wherever there are
trees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span> or bushes,
scarcely seemed to notice our passage, and would remain perched
upon a bough close beside the track. Here in the city of Marocco a
small bird about the size of a sparrow, but much more elegant in
shape and attractive from its green-grey plumage—the
<i>Fringillaria Saharæ</i>—displayed still greater boldness. During
our meals, which were always taken in the central saloon open to
the sky, they would boldly alight beside us, and pick up the crumbs
that were sometimes purposely scattered for their benefit.</p>

<p>We saw nothing of the harmless serpents, one of which at least
is said to inhabit every house in Marocco, and which the natives
consider it unlucky to destroy or drive away. Probably they find
the food that suits them only in inhabited houses, and ours had
been so long untenanted that they had deserted the empty rooms.</p>

<p>Sunday, May 7, was fully employed in completing the arrangements
for our journey, and packing up the botanical collections already
secured. Our men had doubtless enjoyed the rest, and were gratified
by a distribution of new shoes, or rather slippers, which replaced
those pretty thoroughly worn out on the journey from Mogador. In a
country where the surface is generally stony, and the soil abounds
in plants beset by thick sharp spines, the thin slippers
universally used by the people are very soon consumed.</p>

<p>Abraham appeared to-day gorgeously arrayed in a new suit, with
dark yellow boots such as are worn by Moors of the better class. He
had grown much in importance during the last few days, since, in
his capacity as our interpreter, he, a Jew, has sat with his
slippers on in the presence of El Graoui, the most powerful subject
in Marocco.</p>

<p>With regard to the position of the Jews, there can be no doubt
that the benevolent efforts of Sir Moses Montefiore, backed up by
the representatives of England and other civilised States, have
produced some permanent<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_157">[157]</span> effect. In the coast towns, under the eyes
of European consular agents, they seem to enjoy security from
violence, and even from insult. In the city of Marocco, where they
inhabit a separate quarter, walled in and accessible only by two
gates, they are safe so long as they keep within those limits; but
they are still forced to walk barefoot when they pass into the
city, and are exposed to derision and insult against which they
dare not protest. In the remoter parts of the territory, where
their scattered communities are found here and there, their
condition is apparently still worse, and they are frequently
subjected to brutal ill-usage; but even there their superior
intelligence and skill in industrial crafts, for which the Moor is
incompetent, secures them a certain degree of consideration.<a id=
"FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>We this day made acquaintance with Kaïd el Hasbi, the captain of
the escort of five men, who, along with our Mogador guard, was to
travel with us through the Atlas. Nature had given him a
disagreeable countenance with a forbidding expression, and our
subsequent experience fully confirmed the first unfavourable
impression.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that our first day’s journey from Marocco
was to be a short one, and accordingly our final start on Monday,
May 8, was delayed until 8 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> Our large
tent, too heavy for mules, had been sent back to Mogador; but,
nevertheless, our baggage formed a very sufficient load for nine
mules. Not counting our interpreter and Hooker’s European
attendant, we had nine followers engaged in various capacities,
besides twelve men in charge of the hired animals, making up
altogether, with the escort, who numbered nine privates and two
officers, a party of thirty-seven men and thirty-three horses and
mules. We wound slowly through the filthy lanes of the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> Jews’ quarter, and went out by
the south-east gate of the city, having on our right the high wall
that encloses the vast gardens attached to the Sultan’s residence.
Having entered the city through groves of the date-palm, the
foliage of which is too tough for the teeth of the locust, we had
scarcely noticed these pernicious creatures on that occasion; but
in the well-irrigated tracts south and west of the city which are
devoted to tillage they had this year been more than usually
destructive. It is in their young condition, while still active on
the wing, that their voracity is greatest; but in that stage it is
practically impossible to contend with them. When they have
attained their full growth they become unwieldy, and at length
nearly torpid; and it is then that the natives endeavour to
exterminate them, with a view to prevent the females from
depositing their countless eggs and leaving to the district a
legacy of future devastation.</p>

<p>It seemed that El Graoui, for his own reasons, wished to give us
a parting testimony of good-will and favour, without at the same
time committing himself too glaringly for native ideas. It was not,
doubtless, by mere accident that about a mile outside the walls we
found him close to our track, with a train of mounted attendants,
superintending the process of locust slaughter, and were informed
that he wished to bid us farewell. Mounted on a splendid black
charger, the old man, in spite of his unwieldy figure, had a
commanding appearance. His manner was quite friendly; and, as the
brief conversation proceeded, he rode along with us for a couple of
hundred yards, and then shook hands with many good wishes for our
safety and success.</p>

<p>The process of locust destruction which El Graoui was supposed
to superintend was of the rudest description. The bodies of the
bloated sluggish insects are swept into heaps with rough brooms,
and a fire of twigs is then lighted over each heap. On the way from
Sektana to Mogador, Maw afterwards saw another more
expeditious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> process
adopted in a part of the country intersected by open irrigation
channels. Rough screens made of reeds are set up along one side of
the watercourse, as shown in the annexed cut, and the inactive
insects, being driven against them, fall into the water and are
drowned. Some effect may doubtless be produced by these
contrivances; but it seems very doubtful whether, if every locust
that reaches the inhabited districts were destroyed, the plague
would be materially abated. In a region including wide tracts
almost without population there are unlimited opportunities for
depositing the eggs; from these arise countless swarms, which, in
their active condition, are capable of traversing wide spaces in
search of nourishment. The suppression of the locust plague
probably</p>

<figure class="iw2" id="i07"><img src='images/i07.jpg' alt=''>
</figure>
</div>

<p class="nind">awaits the spread of some creature to which their
eggs would afford suitable food.</p>

<p>In great measure influenced by Washington’s account of his visit
to Tasseremout, and his conviction that from that place the highest
ridge of the Atlas might be reached in a single day’s excursion, we
had decided on making that our first halting-place; and, as the
distance can be little over twenty miles, we reckoned on reaching
it by evening. Our way lay about due south-east through the
district of Mesfioua, which is under the rule of a Kaïd, or
subgovernor, subject to the orders of El Graoui.</p>

<p>To the eye the country seems a dead level; but the rapid flow of
water in the covered channels and smaller<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_160">[160]</span> open rivulets showed that the slope of the
ground from south to north is very decided. Along the smaller
watercourses we noticed in abundance what appeared to be a new
<i>Pulicaria</i>, but was afterwards found to be the same as an
eastern species (<i>P. longifolia</i>) described by Boissier.</p>

<p>We rode along in high spirits, delighted to leave the city, and
still more with the near prospect of setting foot on the mountain
chain whose unknown recesses had so long been a fascination for us;
and the only drawback on our enjoyment was the shifting veil of
clouds that hung about the higher summits, only now and then
allowing some rugged peak to stand out for a few moments. As we
gradually drew nearer, our attention was more and more fixed on the
remarkable line of flat-topped bluffs, conspicuous in the view from
the city, that extends for a distance of fully twenty miles along
the base of the Atlas chain, and on the east side seems to jut out
in a northern direction. From a distance the face appears quite
precipitous and almost vertical, and there is but one conspicuous
break in its continuity. This, as we afterwards found, is caused by
the stream running under Tasseremout, which has cut a deep channel
through the barrier.</p>

<p>After riding about three hours we approached an inhabited place,
which we were told was the residence of the Kaïd. We had left
behind us the tract of country ravaged by locusts, and the general
aspect of things was here much brighter than we had beheld since
leaving the coast region. The more brilliant green and more
vigorous growth of herbaceous plants led us to infer that,
irrespective of the influence of irrigation, the zone extending
round the base of the mountain region must receive at least some
share of the more frequent rains that occur there at seasons when
the low country in general is condemned to utter drought. On
reaching the <i>kasbah</i> of the Kaïd, which showed as a low but
substantial building, with walls sloping outward, we were accosted
by an official deputed to apologise for the absence of his chief,
who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span> was to return
towards evening, and to invite us to halt there for the remainder
of the day. As it was now about noon, this proposition was met at
once by a decided negative, when the chief of our Marocco escort
intervened and, with an air of dogged insistance, urged the
necessity for a halt. There ensued the first of many an altercation
with the same disagreeable person, in which it is needless to say
that Hooker’s decision and firmness prevailed, and the order went
forth to continue our journey.</p>

<p>Amongst the bushes near at hand we for the first time gathered a
curious, but no way ornamental, Cruciferous plant, first found by
M. Balansa, which exhibits the only distinct generic type yet found
in the interior of South Marocco, and has been described by M.
Cosson under the name <i>Ceratocnemum rapistroides</i>. It here
grew four or five feet high, with long slender branches; but in
open places we afterwards found it in comparatively stunted
condition—a foot, or less, in height.</p>

<p>The country, after quitting the <i>kasbah</i>, gradually changed
its character. Scattered blocks of moderate size showed themselves
with increasing frequency, and seemed to be of very varied
composition. Some were formed of a coarse-grained sandstone or fine
conglomerate, others appeared to be granitic, though deficient in
mica, while others looked like porphyry. The restrictions by which
we were bound prevented us from undertaking any close examination,
and still more from attempting to carry away specimens. The
predominance of silex in the soil was made apparent by the
vegetation. We had already often admired the pretty little
rose-coloured <i>Spergularia diandra</i>, common on sandy soil
throughout Southern Marocco; but this here became a conspicuous
ornament; its numerous delicate flowers forming large cushions of
bright colour on the surface of the soil. Among other
characteristic species not before seen were <i>Aïzoon
canariense</i> and a new species of <i>Anthemis</i>; but the
predominant element in the vegetation was furnished by the
<i>Leguminosæ</i>, and especially<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_162">[162]</span> by the genera <i>Trifolium</i>,
<i>Medicago</i>, <i>Ononis</i>, and <i>Lotus</i>. Of the first two
genera we found in the lower region none but the common
Mediterranean species, while the others displayed many local forms.
One <i>Ononis</i> here found was altogether new; and a
<i>Lotus</i>, not elsewhere seen in our journey, seemed identical
with an Oriental species not hitherto found west of Greece.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the upward slope of the ground towards the foot
of the great range became much more perceptible, though still very
gradual. At near 4 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, we arrived at
another house belonging to the Kaïd of Mesfioua, and were informed
that that functionary was waiting to receive us, and expected us to
halt there for the night. The instinctive feeling of an Englishman
who has made up his mind to accomplish a certain distance in his
day’s journey is to close his ears to any suggestion of delay, and
all the more decidedly when there is reason to think that other
people are scheming to oppose him; so at first it seemed as if we
should have further altercation with our escort. But as prudence
pointed out that, whatever the feelings of the local authorities
might be in our regard, it would be injudicious to do anything to
give offence, and as at the same time the appearance of the country
near at hand promised good botanising, we speedily decided on
making a virtue of necessity, and with sufficiently good grace
agreed to pitch our tents. By this time the Kaïd had come out to
receive us, but retired after a brief salutation, it being
understood that conversation was reserved till evening.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, we sallied forth with our portfolios,
attended by one of the soldiers who was supposed to watch over our
safety, and directing our steps to a dry river-bed that winds
through the plain close by, were rewarded for our self-denial by
finding a number of interesting plants not before seen. The most
conspicuous of these was a <i>Tamarix</i>, which in some places
grew thickly near the banks. It is remarkable for the bright
pink<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span> colour of the
seed vessel, and differed much in general aspect, though not widely
in structure, from the common <i>T. gallica</i>. The river-bed is
probably the natural channel of the stream that flows below
Tasseremout, part of which is diverted into irrigation channels,
but during rainy weather resumes its original course.</p>

<p>As the sun declined the clouds cleared away from the higher
ridges of the Atlas, of which we enjoyed the finest view we had yet
attained. Nearly due east and thence bearing towards ESE., was a
group of high summits which, to judge from several large patches of
snow, must be quite as lofty as that nearer to us. Between this,
which belongs as we believe to the district called Glaoui, and the
nearer range it was clear that a considerable valley runs deep into
the chain. The drainage of this valley must flow to the Oued
Tensift; but whether that be the main eastern branch of the river,
or an affluent not indicated on the maps, is as yet uncertain.</p>

<p>After dinner, we adjourned from our tent to pay our promised
visit to the Kaïd, who, according to custom, had green tea served
in a small low room, which was reached through intricate passages.
As a matter of course, the object of our journey was the chief
topic of conversation. Among other plants we spoke of the
<i>furbioun</i>,<a id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or <em>Gum Euphorbium</em>, which we knew
to be produced by a cactoïd <i>Euphorbia</i> that grows about the
base of the Great Atlas, east of the city of Marocco. Concurrent
native testimony fixes the province of Demenet as its chief home;
and it must be very rare, or altogether absent, in the districts
traversed by us, as it is scarcely possible that it should have
been overlooked. Apparently conciliated by some trifling presents,
the Kaïd informed us that he had in his garden some plants brought
from Demenet, and offered one of these, which was safely forwarded
to Kew, as a gift to Hooker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>When nearly
ready to start on the morning of May 9, we were informed that the
Kaïd meant to accompany us on the way to Tasseremout.<a id=
"FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
This caused a slight delay, which was not unpleasantly occupied in
looking around us. The morning air was delightfully cool (58° Fahr.
at 6 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>), although the day before had
been hot, and at 11 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> the thermometer
had fallen only to 73°. The position of the Kaïd’s dwelling was in
itself very beautiful, in the midst of a fertile country encircled
by hills, and these backed by a majestic range of lofty mountains.
The line of escarpment skirting the base of the Atlas, already
distinctly seen in the view from Marocco, was conspicuous on the
eastern side, but towards the south was partly concealed by fine
olive groves. The mean of two nearly concordant observations gives
for the height of this place 2,399 feet (731·1 m.) above the
sea.</p>

<p>At about 7 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> we moved, and, crossing
the dry riverbed, very soon began to ascend among low hills,
apparently formed by erosion from an upper plateau that surrounds
the base of the mountains. We often rode along hollow ways between
high banks or lofty hedges formed of tangled shrubs and climbing
plants, in which were mingled some familiar forms with several
altogether new to us. A dog-rose, scarcely distinguishable from the
common British <i>Rosa canina</i>, was common in some places, along
with profuse masses of <i>Ephedra altissima</i> and other southern
forms. Climbing high over all these was a beautiful
<i>Coronilla</i>, with very large white and lilac-blue flowers. We
knew that a fine species of this genus, first brought from Marocco
by Broussonnet, had been formerly cultivated in England, though
long since lost from our gardens; but the <i>Coronilla
viminalis</i> figured by Salisbury shows yellow flowers, and is
placed amongst the shrubby species of the genus. It was clear that
in the plant before us the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_165">[165]</span> stems die down nearly to the root every
winter; and our belief that this was an entirely new species only
yielded to subsequent careful examination, which proved that it is
no other than Broussonnet’s plant.</p>

<p>The date-palm had disappeared soon after we entered the hills;
here, and elsewhere on our route, it seems to be confined to the
lower region, rarely attaining the level of 3,000 feet above the
sea. Its place was here supplied by the palmetto (<i>Chamærops
humilis</i>), which seldom forms a trunk, perhaps because it is not
allowed to attain a sufficient age. As we advanced, the vegetation
constantly offered a more varied and attractive aspect; and one of
our first prizes was a new species of thyme (<i>Thymus
maroccanus</i>, Ball), somewhat like the species of the Argan zone,
but with oblong leaves and uncoloured bracts. Of comparatively
familiar forms there were <i>Cistus monspeliensis</i>, and <i>C.
polymorphus</i>, the first species of that genus that we had seen
in South Marocco, the pretty little <i>Cleonia lusitanica</i>, with
many other Labiatæ. Of plants new to our eyes by far the most
interesting was the curious <i>Polygala Balansæ</i>. To those who
know only the milkworts of Europe and North America, it must seem
strange to hear of a large shrubby Polygala, with branches that end
in a sharp point, few small leaves, so quickly deciduous that it
generally appears quite leafless, and large flowers of a showy
purple-red colour. In truth, although there is great variety of
form in this large genus, the species which is common throughout
the lower valleys of the Great Atlas is very distinct from all its
congeners. In Arabia and South Africa there are some species
forming dwarf bushes with spinescent branches, but in other
respects very different. When full grown this is six or eight feet
in height; and the round, green, almost leafless stems give it,
when the flowers are absent, much the appearance of <i>Spartium
junceum</i>, the large broom of Southern Europe.</p>

<p>After riding some way up a rather steep stony track,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> we reached a grove of very
fine olive trees, and our escort came to a halt. We had reached
Tasseremout. For some time we had seen a large pile of solid
masonry which crowned the hill immediately above the olive grove.
This seemed to deserve a visit; but, on the other hand, the
attractions of the surrounding vegetation were irresistible to
botanists. The matter was settled by Hooker proceeding to visit the
castle with the Kaïd, while Ball botanised,</p>

<div class="figcenter iw2">
<figure class="iw2" id="i08"><img src='images/i08.jpg' alt=''>
<p>FORT AT TASSEREMOUT.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p class="nind">and Maw secured living specimens of some of the
more interesting plants.</p>

<p>The castle of Tasseremout is one out of a large number of
similar buildings standing on the northern outworks of the Great
Atlas chain that will afford interesting matter for inquiry to
future travellers when the country becomes more accessible, and the
lessened jealousy of the natives will make a thorough examination
of them less impossible than it would be at present. The natives
vaguely attribute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
their construction to Christians or Romans, the same word conveying
either meaning; but the Jews often explain this to mean Portuguese.
The general character of these buildings, as far as our information
goes, is tolerably uniform. The walls are of great thickness and
built of rough hewn stone: the arches are always rounded and the
lower chambers vaulted; and they are evidently places of defence.
There is little reason to believe that the Portuguese, who held at
one time or other most of the Atlantic coast of Marocco, ever
established a firm footing inland, and still less that they had
such a hold on South Marocco as would be implied by the erection of
a chain of forts along the foot of the Atlas. On the other hand,
the history of Mauritania during the long period of the decline of
Rome, and preceding the Saracen conquest, is an almost complete
blank, save for a few apocryphal stories. It is certain that the
lower country was once completely subject to Roman power and Roman
institutions, and it remains to be ascertained how far an organised
government survived the weakening of the central authority. That
the independent tribes of the Atlas may have been inconvenient
neighbours to the half-Romanised inhabitants of the plain is more
than probable, and that the forts should have been erected to hold
the former in check seems the most likely conjecture as to their
origin. Excavation, whenever that may be practicable, will scarcely
fail to tell something of the original occupants of these
buildings, and to diminish our ignorance of a dark period of past
history.</p>

<p>As to the question which interested us most nearly, the Kaïd had
at first been reserved; and when it became necessary to decide, his
language was decidedly unfavourable. It was impossible, he said, to
reach the high mountains with snow on them from Tasseremout. Any
one attempting to do so would pass beyond his district, where he
could not protect us, and he could not allow us to incur such a
risk. We remembered Washington’s account of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_168">[168]</span> his winter excursion from this place;
and, what was more curious, we found that a tradition of the visit
of Christians who have gone up the mountains here many years before
survived among the people. When, in December, 1829, the late Sir J.
Drummond Hay was received at Marocco with great distinction by the
then Sultan, it was arranged that, after taking leave of the
sovereign, the party should enjoy two or three days’ hunting
towards the foot of the Atlas, and they accordingly encamped
somewhere below Tasseremout. Washington and some other officers
attached to the mission resolved to take the opportunity for
ascending the mountains as far as possible. At starting they
evidently thought it practicable to attain the higher peaks from
this place by a continuous ascent, and appear to have been
surprised to find, after several hours’ climbing, when they had
reached and somewhat passed the limit of the winter snow, that the
‘highest peaks were still far beyond their reach.’ To one familiar
with high mountain countries, the natural course for attaining to
the backbone of a considerable chain is by penetrating to the head
of one of the deeper valleys; and the course taken by Washington’s
party would appear no more promising than the attempt to scale
Monte Rosa from the plain of Piedmont by ascending the mountains
behind Ivrea. The mountain stream that flows below Tasseremout
seems to come from the SE., where the range presents no conspicuous
summits; whereas the higher points visible from our camp at
Mesfioua lay nearly due south. We were therefore not inclined to
insist on carrying out our original design of making Tasseremout
our base of operations; and when we were told that the valley of
Ourika, lying some distance to the west, led to the snowy
mountains, we at once decided on moving thither in the course of
the afternoon. To console us for our disappointment, the Kaïd
invited us to a repast which, like the food supplied at Mesfioua,
was much better cooked than usual. We especially appreciated some
cakes, or bannocks, of wheaten flour that made an<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span> agreeable change from the
biscuit to which we were often reduced.</p>

<p>Our impressions on this our first acquaintance with the outer
region of the Great Atlas were very agreeable. The country appeared
populous and fruitful. There was, indeed, little space for tillage,
and that was of the rudest kind; but besides the olive, which
attains a great size, the carob (<i>Ceratonia Siliqua</i>) and
walnut, both growing to perfection, combine beauty with economic
value. The common <i>Opuntia</i>, or Indian fig, also grows
luxuriantly, and supplies an item in the diet of the natives.</p>

<p>Before we started, about 3 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> a body
of miserable-looking Jews presented themselves, and offered a
<i>mona</i> of olives, chilis, cakes of repulsive appearance, and
some terrible spirituous liquor served in a battered tin teapot.
When we excused ourselves on the ground that we had but just
finished eating, they insisted that we should, at least, partake of
the liquor. Abraham explained that we could not possibly drink out
of a vessel so indescribably foul as the earthenware cup presented
to us; whereupon one of the women lifted the skirt of her filthy
petticoat, and proceeded to polish the cup to her own satisfaction.
There was something pathetic in the abject air of these poor
people, of whom there are many communities in this part of the
Atlas. Born to suffering and oppression, they yet contrive to hold
together, and even increase their numbers, thanks to superior
intelligence and skill which make them almost indispensable to
their neighbours. They are forced by law or custom to wear none but
black outer garments, and the older men have high brimless
cylindrical hats, tapering somewhat towards the top. They had taken
it into their heads that Christian strangers travelling with a
large escort must be persons of influence and authority, and had
come to implore our favour and protection. The men concluded by
kissing the skirts of our <i>jellabias</i>; and, as we were riding
off, the women, who stood in a group behind, advanced and kissed
our knees,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span> in true
Oriental fashion. We were assured by our interpreter, who naturally
sympathised with the people of his own race, that they often suffer
from ill-usage, for which there is absolutely no redress; but it
does not appear that their condition is practically as bad as that
of the same people in Roumania and some other so-called Christian
States. In some respects, indeed, they are better off than their
Mohammedan neighbours. Not suspected of wealth, their head-men are
not liable to be ‘squeezed,’ and, living apart, they are not
engaged in the intestine feuds of adjoining tribes, and not often
victims of the cruelties that accompany them.</p>

<p>During our afternoon ride from Tasseremout to the Ourika river,
our course lay to the SW., along the base of the escarpment which
had so much attracted our notice from a distance; and much
discussion arose as to the origin of the vast masses of boulders
that were spread along the comparatively level shelf along which we
rode, and descended, in some places at least, to the margin of the
plain.</p>

<p>During the ascent from our camp of last night to Tasseremout, we
first made acquaintance with these deposits, at a height of about
3,000 feet above the sea, that of the olive grove at Tasseremout
being 3,534 feet. On the slope to the right of our track a mass of
irregular weather-worn blocks of sandstone lay in disorder, the
most prominent characteristic being that they were all of large
size (measuring from ten to twenty cubic yards, according to Maw),
with little or no intermixture of finer materials. Maw was disposed
to consider these as glacial deposits;<a id=
"FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
but, among other difficulties, it was urged that the moraines of
glaciers descending from a great mountain chain always include a
large proportion of finer materials along with large blocks, and
that these include fragments of the various rocks through which the
glacier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> flows,
while it was <i>primâ facie</i> improbable that such a mountain
chain as that before us should be altogether formed of the
sandstone of which, so far as we could see, the blocks before us
were exclusively composed. Soon after leaving Tasseremout, we came
to the opening of a narrow valley or ravine cutting through the
escarpment, and exposing to view great piles of boulders similar to
those seen below, but on a larger scale. After this, the escarpment
showed an unbroken face for a distance of about ten miles. Seen
near at hand the slope, which from a distance seemed nearly
vertical, appeared to have an inclination of from 35° to 45°, and
rose to an average height of about 1,000 feet above its base. The
upper beds, whose exposed edges were everywhere seen, seemed to
consist of hard limestone with siliceous concretions; while the
lower beds were of less consistent shaly limestone.</p>

<p>The ground over which we rode in a SW. direction, parallel to
the base of the escarpment, was very irregular in form, rising in
places into mounds sloping inwards towards the cliffs as well as
outwards towards the plain; and, although in great part covered
with vegetation, it appeared pretty certain that the whole was
composed of irregular masses of sandstone intermixed to some extent
with fragments of the rocks forming the barrier beside us. To those
who did not admit the probability of the boulders before seen being
deposited by glacial action, the phenomena here presented offered
strong confirmation. A glacier descending from a main valley
necessarily flows down the slope towards the plain, and could not
turn aside at right angles to its previous course, and to the line
of maximum inclination, unless there had been a barrier of solid
rock stopping the way, of which there was here not the slightest
indication. Whether or not materials that are borne down a steep
incline by sub-aërial denudation form a talus with a diminishing
slope resting against the face of the escarpment, or form mounds at
a greater or less distance from the base, is a question
depending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> upon the
momentum with which they descend; and this again depends on three
elements—the weight of the blocks, the steepness, and the length of
the slope. If the greater portion of the materials consist of large
blocks launched down a steep and long incline, these will travel to
a considerable distance from the base of the cliff, and gradually
form a barrier that will stop the course of other similar masses,
until these accumulate into considerable mounds, as may be seen in
many instances of berg-falls in the Alps. Whatever be the origin of
these accumulations in this part of the Great Atlas, it would
appear that the conditions that gave rise to them have now ceased,
as we saw no instance of any large block that appeared to have been
recently borne to its present position.</p>

<p>As it was important to reach our night quarters by daylight, we
collected few plants during the afternoon ride; a fine
<i>Asperula</i>, with numerous flowers varying from white to pink,
seemingly not different from the Spanish <i>A. hirsuta</i>, was a
great ornament here, and in several other places on the skirts of
the Atlas.</p>

<p>As we approached the opening of a considerable valley, it was
apparent that the escarpment ridge here comes to an end, and is not
again traceable as a distinct feature in the scenery on the west
side of the Ourika river. The name Ourika, with which we now became
familiar, appears to be that of a district, governed by a Kaïd
under the orders of El Graoui, which includes a fruitful valley
running deep into the heart of the Great Atlas. Having descended
from the hummocky ground over which our course lay, we struck the
valley just where the stream issues from between the hills below a
village named Achliz. Nearly all the water was at this season
diverted from its natural bed into irrigation channels that are
carried through the plain of Marocco. We rode some way along one of
these channels, bordered by tall reeds, and a grand <i>Senecio</i>,
fully eight feet high, but not yet in flower, probably <i>S.
giganteus</i> of Desfontaines. The wide<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_173">[173]</span> bed of the stream, nearly quite dry,
afforded the most convenient situation for our camp, which, by the
mean of two observations, stood at 2,889 feet (880·6 m.) above the
sea.</p>

<p>Though the more we afterwards knew of him the less we liked him,
we observed, on this and some other occasions, that our
disagreeable Marocco leader, Kaïd el Hasbi, shared in a quality
that is common enough among uncivilised people, and especially
noticeable among the Moors, of which due account should be taken by
travellers. It is not the desire to please, still less real
benevolence; but a certain impressionableness, an involuntary
sympathy, that makes these people thoroughly uncomfortable when
they see a stranger annoyed or disappointed. In common phrase,
‘they can’t bear to see you put out.’ An Englishman, a German, or a
Swiss may travel with you the whole day, when you are suffering
from annoyance, perhaps at something in his own behaviour, but will
either not notice, or, if he do notice, will not heed, your humour.
In this country a man who would see you killed or tortured with
perfect composure, can be made more uneasy than you are by seeing
you vexed or out of spirits. The disappointment we felt at our
first failure to penetrate the inner recesses of the Atlas from
Tasseremout, had been very perceptible during the afternoon; and
though our Kaïd was quite resolved to let us go no farther than he
could possibly help, he wished to do what he could to keep us in
good humour. Accordingly, we were scarcely housed in our tents when
El Hasbi appeared with a supply of fruit, oranges, dates, and
walnuts, that he wished us to regard as a present from himself, but
were doubtless part of the ample <i>mona</i> that was obtained from
the village authorities. Later on, the Kaïd of the valley made his
appearance, civil, but no way cordial, and the result of the
interview was not very favourable to the prospect of penetrating to
the head of the valley.</p>

<p>We were led at the time to suppose that the more<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span> or less overt resistance which
we encountered here and elsewhere in South Marocco, was altogether
due to a fanatical dislike to Christian strangers; but we
afterwards doubted whether that feeling, undoubtedly prevalent
among the Moors, is equally general among the Shelluh population;
and as we came to know more of the practical results of our visits
to these remote valleys, the less surprised we were to know that
they were unwelcome to the inhabitants. The Sultan’s order, as we
learned from El Graoui, had gone forth that we were not to be put
to any expense for the living of ourselves and our attendants
during our journey. So far as our personal consumption went that
was but trifling, as we largely relied on the provisions we had
carried with us. Our attendants no doubt consumed an ample share of
food at the one serious meal of the day, usually after nightfall,
and were ready to set to again in the middle of the night when a
good opportunity was offered; but it was the rapacity of our
soldier escort that made our visit a calamity in a poor district.
Not satisfied with gorging themselves with meat, cakes, and fruit,
they demanded luxuries such as green tea and white sugar, and in
such quantities that, as we afterwards learned, Kaïd el Hasbi used
to send from each valley in which we halted a mule laden with
provisions to his family in Marocco. An altercation which we heard
this night, and which was repeated more than once on subsequent
nights, arose from our usually pacific Mogador Kaïd, who revolted
at seeing the lion’s share of the spoil taken possession of by his
colleague from Marocco. On this occasion the quarrel threatened to
become serious, and the long guns were actually drawn out of the
red cloth cases; but it seemed that on one or both sides discretion
overcame valour, as peace was ultimately restored. Our interpreter,
Abraham, as a prudent man, wished not to embroil himself in these
disputes, and it was only gradually that we got to learn the real
mischiefs and hardships of which we were the involuntary
occasion.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">At</span> sunrise, on April 10,
the thermometer stood at 60°, and in this delightful climate we
were in the best spirits for undertaking the work that seemed to be
ready cut out for us, by exploring the fine valley that led
directly from our station to the heart of the great mountain chain.
Our expectations were, indeed, somewhat damped by the discussions
that had already taken place with the Vice-Governor and with Kaïd
el Hasbi. They did not deny that we might travel some way up the
valley, but asserted that it would not be practicable for us to
‘reach the snow.’</p>

<p>It was impossible to leave the spot where we encamped without
giving a little time for collecting some of the very interesting
plants that grew close at hand. Foremost amongst these was a
leguminous shrub that seems destined to become an ornament to the
gardens of Europe. This—<i>Adenocarpus anagyrifolius</i>, of
Cosson—was first found in 1867, by M. Balansa, and seems to be
common, especially near the banks of streams, between 3,000 and
5,000 feet above the sea level throughout this part of the Great
Atlas. The long racemes of bright yellow flowers were conspicuous
from a distance, and we afterwards found the pods, densely covered
with black glands, but nowhere containing ripe seed. Another new
bush belonging to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_176">[176]</span> same natural order was also seen for the
first time—<i>Hedysarum membranaceum</i>, of Cosson. Unlike the
other, this is rare, and seems to be limited to the lower zone at
the foot of the mountains. We failed to find either flower or
fruit, though M. Balansa gathered both, perhaps at a lower level,
in May 1867. We also collected fine specimens of two new and very
distinct species, first seen on the preceding day—<i>Lotononis
maroccana</i>, Ball, and <i>Lotus maroccanus</i>, Ball.</p>

<p>Soon after 8 we got under way, and, after a short ride along the
right bank, reached the stream above the part where the water is
carried off for irrigation purposes. It was now seen to be a rapid
torrent, from twenty to forty yards in width, and nearly two feet
deep. For some distance the narrow floor of the valley was nearly
flat, and the moist soil was covered with poplars and willows, and
a dense undergrowth of grasses and herbaceous flowering plants.
Among these were two large <i>Ranunculi</i>, and a gigantic orchid,
growing four or five feet high, only a variety of our common
<i>Orchis latifolia</i>.</p>

<p>The vegetation became still more interesting when we left the
flat bottom of the valley, and began to ascend on drier ground,
between tangled masses of bushes that formed a sort of thick hedge
on either side of the track. For the first time in South Marocco,
we saw two species of <i>Clematis</i>—<i>C. cirrhosa</i> and <i>C.
Flammula</i>,—along with several other Mediterranean species; but
our minds were especially exercised by a little bush with slender
twigs and pinnate leaves, which, in default of flower or fruit, we
were at first unable to refer to its place in the natural system.
It turned out to be a curious species of ash, first found in the
plateau region of Southern Algeria, appropriately named by M.
Cosson <i>Fraxinus dimorpha</i>. As long as it remains a bush, with
numerous twiggy stems, the leaflets are blunt and rounded; but when
it becomes a shrub, with a stout trunk, it throws out leaves that
approach in form those of the flowering ash. We nowhere<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> saw it in this condition in
Marocco, and only by the help of Algerian specimens could we have
suspected the identity of the two forms. Among many thorny bushes
we saw here one, first gathered the day before, near Tasseremout,
which Hooker at once pronounced to be a <i>Celastrus</i>. This was
first found in the South of Spain, and described as <i>C.
europæus</i> by M. Boissier, but is in truth one of the many forms
of <i>C. senegalensis</i>, a widely-spread tropical species, that
extends from India to the west coast of Africa.</p>

<p>Among other novelties, we here saw, for the first time, a little
annual stonecrop (<i>Sedum modestum</i>, Ball), that nestles in
hollow places under large stones, or about the roots of trees; but
the most curious trophy of our day’s work was a miniature bramble,
lying flat on earthy banks, with small, mostly undivided leaves,
and very few minute prickles. It is possible that the imperfect
fruits that we saw had been dried up by the sun; but it seems more
likely that this belongs to the group of dry-fruited brambles—the
genus <i>Dalibarda</i> of some botanists—hitherto known only in
America and Eastern Asia.</p>

<p>We passed near to several villages; but, as a rule, the valley
tracks in the Great Atlas are carried on one side, and do not
approach near to the houses. The valley grew narrower as we
advanced, and the moderately steep slopes on either hand were
covered with small trees of <i>Callitris</i>, and <i>Juniperus
phœnicea</i>, none of them more than about thirty feet in height.
If this country were administered by people capable of taking
thought of its future prosperity, the former tree might undoubtedly
become an important source of wealth. The beauty of the wood, if it
were only allowed to attain a sufficient size, would always secure
a ready market, even though it never reached the extravagant price
which, under the name of citrus wood, it obtained in the days of
Imperial Rome. The only use which it serves in Marocco is the
production of gum Sandrac, of which a small quantity is exported to
Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>The destructive
practice of setting fire to the brushwood is the sole cause that
prevents the northern slopes of the Great Atlas from being clothed
with valuable timber. The motive is not only the desire to obtain
pasture for sheep and goats, but also to deprive an enemy of cover
for ambush during the frequent skirmishes that occur between
neighbouring tribes. The olive, carob, and walnut, which are
planted in the main valleys, and produce annual crops, are
carefully protected; but the notion of looking forward to future
profit after an interval of thirty or forty years would be
absolutely unintelligible to a native of this country. By a very
rude process, the natives extract from the trunks and branches of
<i>Juniperus phœnicea</i> a sort of tar which is said to be a
useful application in wounds and sores of men and animals.</p>

<p>As we continued to advance, the valley narrowed almost to a
defile, and the track, carried along rather steep slopes, became
difficult for laden animals, though not worse than one commonly
meets in high mountain countries, nor nearly so bad as some that we
afterwards traversed in the Atlas. Presently, Abraham announced
that Kaïd el Hasbi declared the track too bad for farther progress
of the baggage mules. As it was apparent that the valley widened
out a short way ahead, and that the <i>mauvais pas</i> would soon
come to an end, we turned deaf ears to the remark, and rode
doggedly on for a short distance farther, encouraged by the view in
front, which disclosed a long reach of valley, running deep into
the heart of the great chain. Shortly after, those who were in
front became aware that a vehement discussion was going on at the
centre of our scattered line. The energy of our interpreter was
taxed to the utmost in striving to render the emphatic sentences
that were exchanged between Hooker and Kaïd el Hasbi, supplemented
by the pantomimic gestures of the latter.</p>

<p>The gist of the argument was to the effect that even if we did
go some way farther, at the risk of our baggage<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span> animals rolling down into the
torrent—one of them had already slipped, and had a narrow
escape—our progress to the head of the valley was out of the
question, as the people there were in full revolt, and would not
recognise the authority of the Sultan. We were inclined at the
moment, and afterwards, to believe that this was a lie trumped up
for the occasion; but the story might possibly be true, and,
whether it were so or not, it was clearly impossible for us to
proceed against the positive and determined opposition of our
escort. With feelings of bitter disappointment we dismounted, and
ordered that the baggage should return to a village near which we
had passed an hour before, while we climbed to the top of a
projecting spur of the mountain, commanding a view of the upper
valley. For the moment, our interest in the vegetation yielded to
the attractions of the scenery, and our curiosity as to the nature
of the great mountain chain that rose steeply before us, seamed
with snow that nowhere formed wide fields of <i>névé</i>, but lay
in hollows and ravines forming long vertical streaks throughout the
upper zone of several thousand feet in height. About two miles
ahead of us the valley forks, the main branch from SSE. receiving a
tributary from the S. or SSW. On a lofty spur between the two
streams stood a village, conspicuous from a distance.</p>

<p>To be turned back at the very moment when the main object of our
journey lay before our eyes, and that on pretexts that we utterly
disbelieved, was sufficiently aggravating; and it was not in the
most cheerful humour that, about mid-day, we retraced our steps
down the valley, and, yielding to the suggestions of our escort,
halted at the olive grove beside the village which we had noticed
during our ascent. This was the first Shelluh village that we had
been able to inspect nearly, and it was of the same type which we
afterwards found throughout the mountain region. Unlike the Arabs,
the Berebers always use stone for building when it is available.
The walls are thick and solid<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_180">[180]</span> below, but rudely constructed, and the
upper portions are sometimes put together with mud and small pieces
of stone. There is usually an upper story extending over the whole
or part of the ground floor, and the roofs are flat and made
tolerably water-tight with mortar or cement. In structure and
appearance they reminded Hooker of the village houses of the
mountaineers of Bhotan.</p>

<p>We collected a good many specimens during the afternoon, but
were able to add little to the list of species already noted in the
valley. The most important business in hand was to bring to book
our enemy Kaïd el Hasbi—for so we began to consider him—and
ascertain clearly whether he did or did not mean to carry out the
orders of the Sultan, and convey us to some point within reach of
the upper regions of the mountains. When pressed on this point, he
distinctly declared that from Reraya—the next adjoining district to
the west—we should be able to ‘reach the snow;’ and with that
assurance we had to satisfy ourselves, and give such orders that
the next evening should find us in the desired district.</p>

<p>The name of the village was differently noted by the members of
the party; Assghin, as it is entered in Hooker’s notes, by an
observation taken this afternoon, with the thermometer in the shade
at 72° Fahr., stands at 3,427 feet (1,044·4 m.) above the sea. Up
to this our observations had been reduced on the assumption that
the pressure at sea level was exactly 760 millimetres; but
henceforward we had the advantage of direct comparison with
observations recorded twice a day at Mogador.</p>

<p>The evening was fine, but flashes of lightning were seen to the
SE. after dark, and during the night fresh snow fell on the higher
ridges, which looked brilliant on the early morning of April 11,
but rapidly melted under the mid-day sun. We started rather late,
about 8 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>, and by 10.30 had returned to
the site of our former camp in the broad bed of the stream below
Achliz. Here our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
ill-humour was increased by a long and quite unnecessary delay. As
a rule, a light luncheon was all that was consumed at our mid-day
halt, the men being content with some fragments of the <i>mona</i>
of the previous night. But our greedy soldiers had requisitioned a
further <i>mona</i>, nominally on our behalf, from the adjoining
village, and were determined not to move forward until it was
supplied. When Hooker happened to surprise our Mogador Kaïd in the
act of secreting a quantity of tea and sugar, the old fellow in
self-defence began to narrate the misdeeds of his colleague, and so
gave us a clearer notion than we before had of the sort of abuses
that pervade the whole fabric of Moorish administration. It is true
that one is told that the value of goods requisitioned in this way
by Government officers is allowed to the villages as payment on
account of taxes; but the poor country people tell a different
tale, and it is probable that any allowance made on this head is
quite inadequate.</p>

<p>It was 2.30 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> when we were at last
able to start, and, as we knew that there was still some distance
to travel, we had but very little time for botanising during the
afternoon ride. Our way lay for more than two hours along the base
of the hills, whose forms were much of the pattern usually seen
where a high mountain rises from a plain country. The ridges
dividing the main valleys gradually diminish in height as they
recede from the axis, and ultimately are weather-worn into
eminences of a more or less conical form, which project to an
unequal distance towards the plain.</p>

<p>Towards five o’clock we began to ascend to a low pass connecting
a long projecting spur to the right with the main mass of the hills
on our left. Up to this we had seen a good many scattered blocks of
sandstone, but nowhere forming mounds. We now came on limestone—
showing traces of fossils. The hills hereabouts were bare of trees,
with a thick growth of palmetto, bushy <i>Labiatæ</i>,
<i>Helianthemum</i>, and perennial grasses, except where,
under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span> tillage, they
produce good crops of red-bearded wheat. From the first pass we
descended rather steeply to cross a narrow torrent bed, and
reascend to a second somewhat higher pass, reached at 6
<span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, which we found to be 3,590 feet
(1,094·3 m.) above the sea, or just 700 feet above the river at the
mouth of the Ourika valley. The country here appears to be fully
peopled. We saw several villages, and one or two quadrangular
buildings of larger size, probably the dwellings of local sheiks.
We had during most of the way wide views over the plain of Marocco,
and were able to distinguish the city itself, with the great tower
of the Koutoubia and the extensive palm groves on its western side.
Slight undulations of the ground are not perceptible when seen from
above; but it was quite clear to us that nothing deserving to be
called a hill breaks the uniformity of the gentle slope with which
the plain subsides from the base of the Atlas to the region
traversed by us on our road from Mogador.</p>

<p>The monotony of the march was diversified by another furious
quarrel between the officers of our escort. Whatever may have been
the pretext, the cause was doubtless the mutual ill blood arising
from the disputes over their respective shares of the spoil
obtained from the villagers. Not content with volleys of guttural
abuse, and seemingly ferocious threats, they appeared intent on
serious mischief, and proceeded to unpack their long guns. Luckily
these were securely wrapped up in complicated covers of red cloth,
and, before the combatants were ready for action, prudence once
more restrained valour, and the storm passed away in sullen
growlings and mutterings of future vengeance. It sometimes struck
us that if there were such things as professional brigands in
Marocco, we might have been robbed or murdered with perfect safety
before one of the guns of our escort had been extracted from its
case, and made ready for use.</p>

<p>Indignant, as we were, at the rapacity of our escort, we assured
ourselves, when we came to know more of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_183">[183]</span> country, that there is a great deal of
human nature among the Moors, as there is amongst most of the
people that travellers make acquaintance with, and that the conduct
of the soldiers and their officers was pretty much what might be
expected from any other men put in the same position. The pay of a
captain in the regular army is equivalent to 4<em>s</em>.
2<em>d</em>. per month, and that of the men not nearly enough to
support life, even allowing for the frugal habits of the people. It
is only natural that when the opportunity is offered, along with
the certainty of impunity, they should make the most of it, as they
certainly do. In some places, as we afterwards learned, they were
not satisfied with the large supplies that they requisitioned, but
demanded and obtained money from the village authorities.</p>

<p>From the summit of the second pass, the track descends about 400
feet into a broad valley, well wooded with olive, carob, and other
cultivated trees.</p>

<p>Soon after seven o’clock we reached a convenient spot on flat
ground, beside a rapid stream, near a village called Tassilunt. The
scenery here was very picturesque, although we had no view of the
higher part of the chain. The nearer mountains were of a deep red
colour—probably sandstone—contrasting finely with the rich green of
trees and shrubs that covered most of the slopes. The floor of the
valley here, as in most parts of the range that we visited, is
chiefly devoted to olive cultivation, poor crops of grain being
raised beneath the trees.</p>

<p>The sheik of the village soon presented himself, and before long
an abundant <i>mona</i> was brought to the tent door, and laid,
according to custom, at Hooker’s feet. Five large dishes of cooked
meat and keskossou, and piles of wheaten cakes, were designed to
stay or to whet the appetites of the party; while a sheep, twelve
fowls, fifty eggs, and five pounds of butter formed a provision for
their future wants. When it is remembered that nearly as much more
cooked food was supplied in the morning, it<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_184">[184]</span> may be imagined that the tax on the
resources of a poor mountain village was not trifling.</p>

<p>We had now entered the district of Reraya, which is under the
rule of El Graoui, represented by one or more deputies. The whole
population, excepting some miserable-looking Jews, is Shelluh; but
here, as everywhere among the Berebers, these are divided into
tribes or clans, who are often at feud, and always jealous and
suspicious of each other. There is generally a superior chief or
sheik, having a wide, but ill-defined authority over the whole
clan; but among those that recognise the Sultan’s paramount
temporal as well as spiritual supremacy, this is subordinate to
that of the Governor. In this part of the Great Atlas, the clans,
as well as the districts named after them, preserve the Shelluh
patronymic of <i>Aït</i>; but the Bereber tribes of the high ranges
E. and SE. of Fez have generally adopted the Arabic <i>Beni</i>, as
with the powerful tribes, Beni Mtir and Mghill. One of the many
difficulties of the geographer in this country arises from the
practice of naming each district from the tribe that inhabits it,
and the fact that, either from compulsion, or a taste for
migration, it is not uncommon for a tribe to remove from one valley
to another. The next valley to that where we now were was called at
this time Aït Mesan; but if the Aït Mesan should take possession of
some neighbouring valley, or be driven out by a stronger tribe, the
traveller who visits the country some years hence may find the Aït
Mesan valley in quite another place from that which we have
described.</p>

<p>Our chief anxiety now, was to ascertain that the promise held
out, of penetrating to the inner recesses of the Great Atlas in the
district of Reraya, was to be realised. We were told that in the
next adjoining valley we should reach a place only two hours’
journey from the snow, and that the sheik of that valley had been
summoned, and would arrive on the next morning. At the same time,
whether from ignorance or a design to mislead us, El<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span> Hasbi’s language was decidedly
vague and confused, and, after the experience of the last few days,
there was no reason to feel the slightest confidence in his
assurances. Hooker therefore decided on bringing matters to a point
by informing El Hasbi that if any further difficulty was made, he
should despatch a courier with letters for El Graoui and the
Viceroy at Marocco, saying that the commander of our escort has
failed to carry out the Sultan’s orders, and requesting that
another should be sent in his place. As this was the last thing to
suit El Hasbi’s book, he became profuse in assurances of devotion
to our wishes, and for some days, at least, we had no reason to
suspect him of further machinations to defeat our plans.</p>

<p>In point of fact, a courier was sent on the following day with a
letter for El Graoui. It was desirable to obtain the direct
sanction of the authorities for our intention to remain several
days in the district we had now reached, and to make it understood
that this would be essential for the object of our journey.</p>

<p>A further topic requiring some previous arrangement arose from
Maw’s desire to return to England as soon as possible, after
effecting the desired ascent to the higher region.</p>

<p>Our camp, which stood at 3,160 feet (963·1 m.) above the sea,
was in a pleasant and sheltered position, and the temperature was
thoroughly enjoyable. The relative coolness of the nights was not,
indeed, so remarkable here as in the plain, for the actual
temperature was pretty much the same, while that of the shade of
day, which at this season, there usually rises somewhat over 80°
Fahr., rarely exceeded 70° in the lower zone of the Great Atlas,
however powerful might be the direct rays of the sun for several
hours in each day. Towards dawn the air was usually keen, often
almost cold; and at the hour which, when possible, was selected for
observation—about one hour after sunrise—Fahrenheit’s thermometer,
as well in the plain as in the main valleys of the Atlas,
usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> ranged from
56° to 60°. It will be seen that this country, when made accessible
to civilised Europe, will supply the nearest approach yet
discovered to the perfection of climate, whether for health or
enjoyment.</p>

<p>The morning of May 12 was in every sense a busy one. During our
afternoon ride of the day before, one of the baggage mules, while
following a narrow track along the bank of a watercourse, had
slipped into the stream, and a large parcel of Hooker’s plants had
been thoroughly soaked. Several hours of the night, and the early
morning, were consumed in repairing the damage, by laying the
plants in dry paper, and drying in the sun that which was wet. Then
came the important affair on which our hearts were mainly set. The
sheik of the Aït Mesan valley had arrived, and it was necessary by
a judicious combination of compulsion and conciliation to secure
his co-operation in our undertaking. It was true that the orders of
his superior, El Graoui, if duly conveyed by our escort, should
alone have sufficed for our purpose; but we had already learned
that, by a mutual understanding between the treacherous El Hasbi
and the local authorities, our progress could at any moment be
effectually barred. How were we to detect and expose the falsehood
of the stories that were daily trumped up, and were seemingly
accepted for truth by our own attendants?</p>

<p>The sheik appeared sufficiently cordial, especially when he was
made to understand that, in case we were satisfied, he should
receive a handsome present; and it was arranged that our next camp
should be fixed at a spot within reach of the snow.</p>

<p>When the time for our departure drew near, a fresh, but not
quite unforeseen, cause for delay presented itself, by the
appearance in our camp of a crowd of native applicants for medical
advice. Before leaving England we had been advised not to neglect
the surest means for conciliating the good will of an African
population, and had fortunately provided ourselves with a
sufficient stock of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
common medicines. Even an ordinary traveller, with no more
knowledge of medicine than the elementary notions possessed by most
educated persons, may safely apply simple remedies in many of the
cases of sickness that commonly occur among uncivilised people; but
in our case there was no occasion for rash experiments, as Hooker’s
medical knowledge and skill were more than sufficient for the needs
of the patients who flocked in considerable numbers to ask for
advice. From this time forward, except in one or two places where
the people were withheld by the bigotry of the authorities, this
became one of the daily demands upon his time and patience.</p>

<p>To judge from our own observation of the Shelluh people, and the
experience of French travellers among the Kabyles, it seems
probable that a traveller having some knowledge of the Bereber
language, and a little medical skill, who could once make his way
among the independent tribes of East Marocco, might safely explore
the unknown portions of the Great Atlas. The first condition would
be, that he should be able to overcome or evade the obstacles that
would be put in his way by the Moorish authorities; and the second,
that he should avoid treating any case that was likely to have a
fatal termination. The position of an infidel stranger who might be
supposed to be accessory to the death of a native of one of these
wild tribes would doubtless be very perilous. The only branch of
natural history that could be followed by a traveller under such
conditions would be botany. In collecting plants he would be
supposed to be following his proper avocation; whereas the
slightest attention given to stones or minerals would be set down
to a search for treasure.</p>

<p>The Shelluh population of the Great Atlas is strikingly
different from the Arab stock, but scarcely to be distinguished in
appearance from the cognate Bereber races, the Riff mountaineers of
North Marocco, and the Kabyles of Algeria. Long faces, of a deep
sallow complexion, high cheek-bones, eyes closely set and not so
dark as those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
the Moors and Arabs, are the prevailing types. The hair is cut
short, and the use of the turban seems to be confined to the women.
The men, when they use an upper garment, wear a black cloak or
large cape of goat’s hair or camel’s hair, into which is inserted
on the back an angular patch of red woollen stuff. Their character
seems even more different from the Arab type than their aspect. The
Arab hates work, takes to it occasionally from necessity, but
passes his time so far as he can between talk, story-telling, and
song, and dreamy contemplation, in which he is helped by the
habitual use of <i>kief</i>, prepared from Indian hemp, the local
substitute for tobacco. The Shelluh, on the contrary, is active and
hardworking. He has some natural fitness and acquired skill in
agriculture. His intelligence is readier for all practical
purposes; and, in spite of difficulties of language, which
generally involved a double process of interpreting between us and
the natives, we found it much easier to obtain information on any
matter of interest than from the Arabs. Intense curiosity was
always shown by them in our proceedings, and a circle of people
from the nearest village, standing hand-in-hand, generally
encompassed our camp.</p>

<p>During the morning Maw amused and interested the people by
showing a little practice with a small English rifle. The long
flint-lock guns and bad gunpowder used in this country form such
ineffective weapons that the people cannot conceive the possibility
of every shot telling. This accounts for the fact that in the
frequent skirmishes that arise between neighbouring tribes so
little damage is usually done. Several hundred men may spend the
day in firing at each other; a vast quantity of ammunition may be
consumed; but the list of casualties on both sides seldom exceeds
half a dozen killed and wounded.</p>

<p>At 11 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> we left our camping ground,
and began to ascend the valley, soon approaching the banks of the
stream, which was everywhere easily fordable. In places<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> where it has cut a channel
through sandstone rock there was space to ride along the bed, and
we here found several rock-plants of some interest. The most
conspicuous was the European <i>Catananche cærulea</i>, not before
seen by us, but extremely common in the interior valleys of the
Great Atlas, growing two or three feet high in the warm zone, and
dwindling to a few inches in colder and exposed stations. Of
greater interest was <i>Selaginella rupestris</i>, a species of
club-moss that makes the round of the world in the tropics, but is
very rare outside those limits.</p>

<p>Before long we began to ascend the slopes on the western side of
the valley. The hill was covered with a dense growth of shrubs and
low bushes, in great part evergreen, and had more the
characteristic aspect of the region surrounding the shores of the
Mediterranean than anything we had seen since leaving Tangier. But,
although there were several identical species, the differences were
very marked, and a single glance sufficed to show that we were far
removed from the flora of North Marocco. The arbutus was the sole
representative of its natural order, and no heath extends to the
Great Atlas. The oak-scrub, in this and the neighbouring valleys,
is all formed of some form of the evergreen oak, <i>Quercus
lusitanica</i>, <i>Q. coccifera</i>, and the allied forms being all
absent. The Alaternus is common to both regions, but a
narrow-leaved form of <i>Rhamnus oleoides</i> is here more common.
Seven species of Cistus that adorn the hills in North Marocco are
on the slopes of the Great Atlas reduced to two, and those the
least conspicuous. On the other hand, the number of bushy Labiatæ
was here largely increased, and included many peculiar species not
known to grow elsewhere; and there were many <i>Umbelliferæ</i>, of
which several were not yet sufficiently advanced for recognition.
Of <i>Leguminosæ</i>, which everywhere play a conspicuous part in
the flora of this region, the most striking novelty was a new
<i>Coronilla</i> (<i>C. ramosissima</i>, Ball), that forms a low
bush, with very numerous slender intricate branches, covered at
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span> season with
rather small yellow flowers. In the midst of so much that was
strange to the eye, it was pleasant to see two familiar European
orchids, <i>Orchis pyramidalis</i> and <i>Ophrys apifera</i>.</p>

<p>There was something comical in the effect of our long
<i>cortège</i>, with the escort swollen to-day by the addition of
three sheiks of the valley, winding solemnly up the slope of the
mountain, but thrown every now and then into general excitement by
the appearance of some unpretending plant. The order ‘catch him
flower’ would then issue to the native attendants, or one or other
of the travellers would set foot to ground the better to inspect
it. But any sense of incongruity between the pomp and circumstance
of our mode of travelling and the simple nature of our favourite
occupation was lost on the natives. To them one pursuit of
civilised man is as unintelligible as another, and they can
conceive no other serious occupation for men not forced to labour
than war or hunting. It is a curious instance of the survival of
barbarous instincts, that a good many people in our own islands,
who imagine themselves to belong to the upper classes of society,
have scarcely advanced a step beyond the mental condition of the
Shelluh mountaineer.</p>

<p>We passed a village where we noticed some rude oil mills; and,
after an ascent of about a thousand feet, reached the summit of the
ridge dividing the valley we had left from the long and important
one, the upper part of which is known, from the tribe that inhabits
it, as Aït Mesan. It is very difficult to trace the course of the
streams that flow northward from this part of the Great Atlas,
because they are so extensively diverted into irrigation channels
that the natural bed is often dry, except after heavy rain.
According to Beaudouin’s map the streams from this and several
adjoining valleys all flow to the Oued Tensift by the east side of
the city of Marocco. This we were led to believe an error in that
map. It is probably true of the Ourika river and its affluents; but
our own observation,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_191">[191]</span> confirmed by the statements of the natives,
led us to think that all the streams from the Reraya district flow
north-westward after entering the plain, and unite with those from
the districts of Gurgouri and Amsmiz to form the river Oued Nyfs,
which we had passed at Misra ben Kara; the same name, variously
pronounced Oued Enfist or Oued Enfisk, being applied to several of
the separate torrents above referred to. It will be remarked that
the name Oued Enfist is merely an anagrammatic form of Oued
Tensift, the main river that drains all this portion of the Great
Atlas; and it is a question whether the natives do not apply the
same name, with the usual laxity as to the order of the consonants,
to all the affluents of the principal stream.</p>

<p>After descending some way on the western side of the ridge, we
came in sight of a large village perched on the summit of a hill,
on the opposite side of the stream that ran at a great depth below
us. This we soon learned to be Moulaï Ibrahim, a <i>zaouia</i>, or
sanctuary, much venerated in all this part of Marocco, governed by
a sherreef, belonging to the family of the saint whose tomb is the
chief building of the village. This semi-independent sherreef gave
permission to M. Balansa to remain in the village for some days in
1867; but just as that active traveller was prepared to attempt to
penetrate into the interior of the chain, an order from El Graoui
made it necessary for him to depart, and follow the direct way to
Marocco. As we came in sight of the <i>zaouia</i>, each of our
troop, Shelluh as well as Moor, commenced to recite prayers, and
then, after prostrating himself on the ground, with his face
towards the sanctuary, proceeded to add a stone to certain heaps
that stood beside the track. The Berebers, in general, are said to
be very lax in conforming to the precepts of the Koran, but they
are as assiduous in their show of reverence for saints and
sanctuaries as the Moors themselves, and it would appear that this
is the only practical form in which their religion exhibits
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>On the summit of
the ridge, which may be about 4,500 feet above the sea, the rock is
a grey schist, often shaly in texture, with the strike about east
and west, and clipping at a high angle approaching the vertical.
These beds may perhaps be identical with the schists, sometimes
containing mica, and sometimes more calcareous in composition,
which we afterwards found at the head of the Amsmiz valley, and
with the rock, described as micaceous schist, seen by Washington in
his ascent from Tasseremout. Our course now lay about due south,
parallel to that of the torrent which ran at a considerable depth
below us. At Moulaï Ibrahim this, according to M. Balansa, is
called Oued Ghaghaia, but we never heard any similar designation
for it. The difficulty of seizing the shades of more or less
guttural sounds from the mouths of the natives makes it not
improbable that the word Ghaghaia of M. Balansa is the same that we
agreed in writing Reraya, and that the name may mean that this is
the stream draining the district of Reraya.</p>

<p>On this ridge we found that curious grass, <i>Lygeum
Spartum</i>, characteristic of Sicily and Southern Spain, where it
is much used for making fine basket-work, but not seen elsewhere in
Marocco. Soon after we lit upon a single specimen of a very fine
plant of the artichoke family, evidently distinct from all those
described, but unfortunately not yet in flower. It has been
provisionally named <i>Cynara Hystryx</i> (Ball). The next find was
not less interesting—an Oriental <i>Echinospermum</i> (<i>E.
barbatum</i> of Lehmann) that extends from the Punjab to Asia Minor
and the Caucasus, but had not before been seen in Africa.</p>

<p>About two o’clock we left behind us the rough irregular ground
over which we had been riding, and found ourselves in a broad open
valley, with a level floor, half a mile or more in width, at the
head of which rose some fine snow-seamed peaks. As we advanced
towards the main chain, our suspicion that the dividing ridge and
the higher peaks were at once more distant and more
lofty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> than had
hitherto been supposed, was more and more confirmed; and we were
soon able to certify that M. Balansa’s expectation that any of the
higher points might be reached in a single day from Moulaï Ibrahim
was based on miscalculation of the scale of these mountains.</p>

</div>

<p>Our short mid-day halt was in a pleasant spot, under the shade
of some very fine carob and olive trees, in view of a village with
large quadrangular windowless buildings, that seemed to show that
the mountaineers here are far better lodged than the people of the
plain. The nearer hills, and one of the higher but nearer peaks,
displayed long unbroken lines of escarpment, formed by the exposed
edges of thick beds of rock (doubtless sandstone), of a deep red
colour, indicated in the annexed plate. We here noticed the first
indication of one prominent characteristic of the Great Atlas
flora—the reappearance of many of the common field plants of
Europe, which are not seen in the lower region. Among others, we
gathered three species of <i>Ranunculus</i> (<i>R. arvensis</i>,
<i>R. parviflorus</i>, and <i>R. muricatus</i>) beside our halting
place.</p>

<p>We were soon again in the saddle, and every step as we advanced
disclosed some new object of interest, either in the scenery that
gradually opened before us, or in the vegetation close at hand. We
passed close to a village where the demeanour of the people was
more distinctly friendly than we had yet experienced since we
landed at Tangier. The whole population—men, women unveiled, and
children—turned out to see the cavalcade pass, and something
approaching to a smile was seen on many a countenance. It appeared
that the fame of Hooker’s skill as a <i>hakim</i> had travelled
before us, and during the following days his patience was often
tried by the numbers who flocked to consult him. In this and the
other neighbouring valleys there are a good many Jews, who appear
to find life among the Shelluhs less hard than among the Arabs of
the plain. True to the instinct of race, they contrive to make a
living as brokers, by conducting the sale of the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> surplus produce of the
mountain country to Moorish traders, and the purchase of the grain,
which must be brought from the low country for the subsistence of
the people.</p>

<p>Some more fine plants were collected by the way. Among these
were three species of <i>Astragalus</i>, one of them new, but
nearly allied to <i>A. narbonensis</i>; and <i>Atractylis
macrophylla</i>, of Desfontaines, a noble plant of the thistle
tribe, much the most ornamental of the genus, reaching a height of
three feet; but, as it flowers late, we saw only the withered heads
of the previous year.</p>

<p>About 6 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> we reached the spot which
was destined to be our head-quarters for several days. The site
chosen was an olive grove, on a shelf of level ground about one
hundred feet above the stream. The soil in the openings between the
trees must have been lying fallow for some time, and was not so
uncomfortably rough as the ploughed land on which we often had to
pitch our tents. The two nearest villages are named Hasni and
Tassghirt; but the former was taken by us as the name of the place
that became to us a sort of temporary home. By the mean of four
nearly concordant observations, compared with those at Mogador, the
height of our camp was 4,205 feet (1,281·8 m.) above the sea.</p>

<p>By the time we were installed in our tents it was nearly dark,
but a much longer delay occurred before the <i>mona</i> arrived
from the neighbouring village. The interval was well employed in a
negotiation with Si Hassan, the sheik of the valley, ending by an
engagement on his part to conduct us on the following day ‘to the
snow.’</p>

<p>With eager anticipation, we rose early on the morning of May 13,
and soon made our arrangements for the day’s excursion. Abraham,
with most of the escort, remained in charge of the camp, while
three or four of the soldiers went with us, and Si Hassan with two
or three wild-looking followers took charge of the expedition.
During the past fortnight, our Mogador attendants, and
especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span> Ambak,
whose superior intelligence was conspicuous, had picked up enough
of English to make the constant presence of a regular interpreter
less necessary than it had been at first, though occasions were
pretty frequent when the attempts at mutual understanding between
us and the Shelluhs were evidently unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Immediately above our camp the valley narrows rapidly, and for
some miles the torrent flows through a mere cleft with steeply
sloping precipitous sides. To avoid this, the upward track ascends
steeply for several hundred feet, and is then carried along the
slope at a considerable height above the torrent. After suffering
from the usual delays, we commenced the ascent about eight o’clock.
The morning was bright, and the temperature delightful. The
thermometer had fallen to 50° about sunrise, but during the day it
stood some ten degrees higher in the shade in the middle part of
the valley. To a party of naturalists it was tantalising work to
ride along the rocky track, passing at every step objects of the
greatest interest, yet unable to do more than snatch a fragment, or
hastily drag up an imperfect specimen. The pace over the broken
ground was necessarily slow, and it was easy for a man on foot to
keep up with the horses; but then the temptation to linger by the
way became irresistible. What botanist could be expected to pass by
new and hitherto unseen forms of vegetable life without at least
securing two or three specimens? As one or other of us yielded to
the impulse, he was called to order by the cry of his companions,
‘We must lose no time—we must keep together’—and so reluctantly
remounting, he was forced to keep time with our sheik guide, who
led the way. At a point about four miles above our camp the valley
opened a little, and near a village (Ouanzerout?) our track lay
through a grove of large olive trees and then descended a little to
cross the stream. We now found this an impetuous torrent, with a
much greater body of water than it had showed where we crossed it
the day before many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
miles lower down, and a rocky bed full of deep holes through which
it was not quite easy to take our horses and mules.</p>

<p>Throughout the valley we were struck by the proofs of native
industry and skill given by the numerous irrigation channels, such
as one sees in Piedmont, and in the tributaries of the Rhone valley
in Switzerland, sometimes cut along steep faces of rock, sometimes
maintained by high terraced banks. Where the ground is favourable,
walnut trees are often planted along these watercourses, and must
largely contribute to the dietary of the inhabitants. It thus
appears that the drainage of the Great Atlas is, in great part,
absorbed by irrigation, even before the streams enter the low
country, while a further portion is there taken up for the same
purpose, and but a small percentage reaches the sea in ordinary
weather. This helps to account for much that at first sight appears
so strange in the hydrography of Marocco. A vast mountain region,
fully exposed to the currents of saturated warm air from the
Atlantic, sends but four rivers to the ocean from its northern and
western flanks, in a coast line of over 400 miles from El Araisch
to Cape Guer; and these, at ordinary times, are all easily
fordable. But when rain falls on the mountains, the irrigation
channels are speedily filled to the brim, and the entire surplus
reaches the rivers, which are then said to rise ten or twelve feet
in the course of as many hours. As bridges are unknown, the Moors
speak of travellers being detained for many days before a flooded
river channel, as a common occurrence.</p>

<p>Above the ford, the valley was again contracted to a mere gorge,
and the narrow path mounts on its eastern flank, and winds along
the extremely steep rugged slopes much after the fashion of some
unfrequented valley of the Southern Alps. Although the sun was
already high, the mountain rose so sheer upon our left that the
shadow often gave welcome protection; and the track was so narrow
in places that we were not free from anxiety for the baggage
animals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>The rock was now
porphyry of a prevailing red colour, which, with occasional
intrusive masses of diorite and dark green basalt, makes up the
whole mass of the central ridge of the Great Atlas in this part of
the chain. As compared with the rich and varied flora, insect life
appeared, at least at this season, to be remarkably scarce, and the
only butterfly noted was <i>Papilio podalyrius</i>.</p>

<p>The porphyry rocks appeared to be very hard, and far less
yielding to erosion than those of somewhat similar character in
South Tyrol. Hence the gullies and ravines cut by the water
channels, round which the track wound, were not nearly so deep as
those that add so much to the picturesqueness of the scenery, and
at the same time to the length of the way for a traveller
traversing the valleys near Botzen. After winding along the slopes
for several miles, our track descended a little to approach once
more the channel of the torrent. The valley was still narrow; but
the inclination of its bed was much less, and the ground on either
bank left space for a track, and in places even for a strip of
cultivation. The natives seem to be quick at availing themselves of
every spot possible for agriculture. Rye and barley were here seen
in ear, and the olive extends very nearly to 5,000 feet above the
sea, or considerably higher than it does on the flanks of the
Lebanon.</p>

<p>As our track ran along the bank of a slender watercourse, it was
completely overarched by a row of elder trees in full flower, that
forced us to lay our heads upon our horses’ necks, one of many
instances of the meeting of the common plants of Northern Europe
with very different endemic forms that characterise the upper
region of the Great Atlas. Some conspicuous plants of the lower
country, and notably <i>Adenocarpus anagyrifolius</i> and
<i>Linaria ventricosa</i>, extended thus far up the valley; and
these, together with a wild <i>Isatis</i>, scarcely different from
the dyer’s woad, gave a prevailing golden hue to the neighbouring
slopes. A reach of the valley now opened before us, backed by a
stern range of dark red bare rocky<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_198">[198]</span> peaks. On our own (the eastern) flank, the
enclosing wall receded somewhat, and above a high and rather steep
convex acclivity stood a village whose people had brought the whole
slope into cultivation. The torrent ran through a cleft on the
right of this knoll, and our course lay directly up it, amidst
fields and meadows, gay with spring flowers, all enclosed within
stiff hedges of thorny bushes, among which our common gooseberry
was abundant. As if because the natives would spare no space that
could be turned to profit, we soon found that on the steeper
portion of the ascent the only way was up the bed of a brawling
stream that had for irrigation’s sake been diverted from the upper
course of the torrent. The track lay over big blocks of porphyry,
with deep holes between, over which the water leaped and tumbled,
between straggling branches of spiny bushes, that left many a mark
on the faces and clothing of the passing horsemen. Up to this we
had little experience of what the horses and mules of Marocco can
do in the way of getting over rough ground, and it was not without
surprise that we saw how successfully they managed to scramble up
the slippery channel over blocks worn smooth by the constant
passage of men and animals. In the midst of the scramble we all
dismounted, for we here saw for the first time the blue daisy of
the Atlas, growing in the shade under the bushes, or nestling in
the hollows between the rocks.</p>

<p>Having reached the top of the knoll at about noon, we found a
sort of shelf of nearly level ground, covered in great part by a
large village of rude but solid stone houses. Here a halt was
called, and we were informed that a <i>mona</i> was provided to
supply the mid-day meal for the party. Burning with impatience, as
we were, this was anything but a welcome announcement. The dark
ridges rising thousands of feet above the head of the valley were
still distant, and no snow was to be seen, save in rifts and
hollows of the rocks, high up and difficult of access; but to
refuse the proffered hospitality of the mountain
chieftain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> would
have been deemed an affront; and to insist on taking our escort on
without food would have caused discontent, if not mutiny. We made a
virtue of necessity, and, while awaiting the repast, carried on a
semblance of broken conversation, in which the ready wit of Ambak,
our ever active attendant, supplied, it is likely, the chief
materials. The name of the village, even more difficult to seize
than usual, was noted by Hooker as Adjersiman. It stands, by our
observations, at 5,535 feet (1,687 m.) above the sea level.</p>

<p>An hour—a whole precious hour—was consumed before the meal was
over, and we were again on our way. Above the village the bed of
the valley rises very steeply, the central part being filled with a
vast mound of huge boulders, which on further examination proved to
be the undoubted remains of the terminal moraine of the glacier
which once filled the head of the valley. The principal mass of
course marked the limit of the glacier during a prolonged period;
but there were traces of two parallel moraines of smaller size, of
which the outer marked the limit of its maximum extension. The
blocks of porphyry and other metamorphic rocks were mostly of great
dimensions.</p>

<p>The track was carried in zigzags up the face of the rocky slope,
keeping towards the top close to the edge of the moraine; and on
reaching the summit of the barrier disclosed to us for the first
time a full view of the head of our valley. A few yards below us
was a small miserable-looking village called Arround, the highest
in this district. This stands at the meeting of two short and
rather broad glens, each enclosed by the rugged masses of the
central range of the Great Atlas. The shorter of the two, which
opened on our left in a SE. or ESE. direction, does not apparently
reach the main watershed, and a pass from its head would in all
probability lead to one of the tributary branches of the Ourika
valley. The other glen that opened right in front of us, somewhat
W. of due S., was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
enclosed by a still loftier and more stern barrier, the rocks,
since the sky had become overclouded, having passed from a dull red
to a dark brown complexion. The ground for some distance behind the
village was flat and swampy, showing that a small moraine lake had
been filled up with gravel and silt. On the level space most of the
soil was under tillage, and wheat as well as rye and barley are
grown, and even maize, as we learned, is raised in this inclement
position. On the low dykes that enclose the little fields we
noticed <i>Iris germanica</i>, evidently planted, but whether for
the production of orris-root, or for the sake of ornament, we
failed to ascertain. The only large tree was the walnut, which had
been planted along the skirts of the cultivated ground.</p>

<p>Now that we were able to pry into the inner recesses of the
chain, we perceived that snow lay in abundance at a much lower
level than we had hitherto supposed, but nowhere in masses of any
great extent. All the higher ridges around us were extremely steep,
though not cut into actual precipices; but on these snow could
nowhere accumulate, save in clefts. Towards their base, however, at
the foot of each narrow ravine that furrowed their faces, at many
spots not much more than a thousand feet above our level, were
large patches that seemed likely to maintain their position for
some time. Though not without experience of mountain lands, we
could none of us call to mind any spot much resembling the scene
before us. Nowhere in the Alps is there anything of at all a
similar character. Excluding the village, and the small fields, and
the walnut trees, which, after all, filled but a small space in the
view, there was something to remind one of the wilder valleys of
the Northern Carpathians, but on a much greater scale. In the
Tatra, as here, the rocks rise in broken masses, very steep but not
quite precipitous, and the snow is seen only in clefts of the
higher ridges, not because the climate forbids it to accumulate,
but because the surface affords so few spots on which it
can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> rest. But the
rocky masses of the Tatra tend to form isolated peaks, usually of
rugged and very steep conical shape; while in this part of the
Great Atlas the depressions that separate the summits are of little
depth as compared to the great height of the range. Seen from
below, as from the spot where we now stood, many points assume the
aspect of sharp peaks; but it is easy to ascertain, by varying the
point of view, that these are mere projecting bastions from the
wall of the main chain, rising little, or not at all, above the
level of the adjoining ridges.</p>

<p>The day was already far gone—nearly two o’clock in the
afternoon—when, leaving our horses at the village, we started on
foot, with our sheik as guide, descending slightly to the level of
the stream, here easily crossed, and then mounting the slope on the
west side of the main branch of the valley in the direction of one
of the nearest of the patches of snow already seen by us. No guide
was needed, for the lower slopes on either side were easily
accessible in all directions; but the sheik evidently wished to
fulfil in person the promise of ‘leading us to the snow.’
Difficulty there was none, except that of moving onward over ground
where every step brought to view some fresh object of interest. It
was clear that we had at last reached the threshold of the <i>terra
incognita</i> that we had so long dreamed of—the subalpine region
of the Great Atlas. There could be no doubt that in the short space
between the lower village and Arround—that is, between the lower
end of the ancient moraine and the ground formerly covered by
glacier—the flora had undergone a complete change. Nearly all the
peculiar species which we had hitherto looked on as characteristic
of the Great Atlas had disappeared, and their place was occupied in
part by others peculiar to this region, and not known elsewhere;
but more largely by species either identical or nearly allied to
well-known mountain plants of the Mediterranean region, along with
some of the common plants<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_202">[202]</span> of middle Europe, including several
familiar British field plants.</p>

<p>It will be more convenient to reserve details for the remarks on
the vegetation of this and the Amsmiz valley, which will be found
in the Appendix; but it must be owned that the general impression
now made, and increased on further acquaintance, was not free from
disappointment. As compared with any of the higher mountain masses
surrounding the Mediterranean, already known to us, this is
singularly unproductive of ornamental species attractive to the
eye. The Sierra Nevada of Granada, the Lebanon chain, and the
mountain ranges of Asia Minor, all exhibit at this season a
multitude of bright-hued plants to delight the traveller, even
though they may not rival the splendour of the higher zone of the
Alps and Pyrenees to one who sees this a month or two later.
Another remarkable feature was the absence of trees, and especially
of true conifers. The dwarf evergreen oak that clothes the middle
zone of the Atlas was no longer seen, and there was no pine, or
spruce, or cedar to take its place. The solitary juniper that we
afterwards saw was scarcely noticed at this, our first, visit. It
is sometimes said that naturalists take no delight in the beauty of
the objects of their study; but this is surely untrue of the great
majority. Probably the notion has arisen from the fact that, in
addition to the sources of pleasure which he shares with the rest
of the world, the naturalist finds food for the sense of beauty as
well as scientific interest, unsuspected by his critics, in
exploring the internal structure of organised beings. Be this as it
may, it is certain that the generally sombre aspect of the
vegetation, harmonising as it did with that of the scenery, had a
somewhat depressing effect on all the members of our party, while
at the same time it only increased our desire to reach the upper
part of the rugged barrier of rock that rose some 5,000 feet around
the head of the valley where we stood.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the afternoon was wearing away; we did<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> not clearly know how we were
to return to our camp after dark, but remembered distinctly one
awkward place—the fording of the torrent—where some daylight seemed
indispensable. We hurried back, our portfolios and tin boxes fully
charged with spoil, and found the horses and mules awaiting us on
the flat ground below Arround. A man can usually travel over rough
mountain tracks as fast as a mule; but if the man be a botanist,
and the track lies among new and rare plants, it is quite certain
that he will not do so; and when haste is a matter of real
importance, it is necessary to submit to the restraint of riding.
Hurried as we were, it was necessary to dismount and make a short
halt on our return to Arround. The laws of Bereber hospitality
required that the villagers should present a <i>mona</i>, and that
we should at least make a show of partaking of it. There was a
large dish of barley porridge, with a lake of oil in a crater-like
hollow in the centre, and another of buttermilk, in which were some
of last year’s walnuts, as well as other unexpected delicacies.
This entertainment was briefly despatched by our followers, and we
proceeded down the steep track beside the moraine, and again
reached Adjersiman. Here, to our vexation, another halt was called,
and another slight refection was presented. Our impatience was so
far successful, that the delay was limited to a very few minutes.
We should, perhaps, have displayed more interest in these specimens
of native cookery, if we had been acquainted with the curious
passages in which Leo Africanus<a id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> minutely describes the
dietary of the Atlas mountaineers, and the mode of preparing the
identical dishes that were here presented to us.</p>

<p>Once more we were in the saddle, and the whole party felt that
no more delay was permitted. To ride down the steep, slippery bed
of the watercourse below the village seemed even a more trying
affair than the ascent; but our companions seemed to take it as a
matter of course, and our<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_204">[204]</span> sturdy beasts accomplished the task
bravely, though not without hard struggling, that would have
strained the muscles of animals less strong and hardy. As always
happens when the ground is looked at in the reverse direction, we
espied, on retracing our track, several plants not before noticed,
one or two of them certainly new. No botanist can resist such a
temptation, even though he were flying for his life; and two or
three times we dismounted to snatch a specimen or two, but were
soon recalled to the necessity for pushing on. For the first time
since we landed in Marocco, the evening sky was overcast with heavy
dark clouds, and the last of twilight was fading fast when we
reached the ford over the torrent. The banks are here overarched by
poplars and other tall trees, and in the dim light the rapid stream
seemed fiercer, and its roar more menacing, than when we crossed it
in the morning. The passage was achieved; but not without a good
deal of excitement among our followers, when one of the soldier’s
horses slipped into a hole, and only after violent plunging and
loud shouting of the natives, scrambled to the farther bank.</p>

<p>Without more trouble we ascended the slope on the western side
of the valley, and reached the olive grove, to which we had given
little attention when we passed through it in the morning. This now
unexpectedly presented the most difficult, and even dangerous,
stage of our excursion. Such faint glimmering of light as remained
up to this disappeared under the trees, and gave place to absolute
pitch darkness. The rough spreading boughs, all beset with the
ragged, leafless, half-dead branchlets characteristic of old olive
trees, stretched out on every side, at a height of four or five
feet from the ground. There was no regular beaten track through the
grove, but by day it was easy for man and horse to thread a way
among the trees. The case was now very different. Our keen-sighted
Shelluh followers were as much at a loss as we were. One or two men
on foot went first, and we then followed, the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_205">[205]</span> train being brought up by the soldiers
of our escort. For a while, by moving slowly and cautiously,
nothing serious happened. The beasts seemed to understand the
difficulty of the case, and as one or another of us rode against a
branch, with head bent down to lessen the risk of mischief, they
stopped at once, and even backed a step or two. Before long the
cavalcade was separated by long gaps. A loud cry of pain, followed
by the vociferations of the natives, brought the foremost to a full
stop, and after a while we were once more near together. It was not
altogether reassuring to be told by Ambak, when we asked the cause
of the row, that one of the soldier’s eyes had been torn out. On
this Ball determined to proceed on foot; but Hooker and Maw, after
a few steps over the very broken ground, thought it better to
remount, and rely on the sagacity of their four-footed
companions.</p>

<p>In our awkward position the time seemed long; but at last we got
through the olive grove, and found when we emerged from it that the
night was even darker than before. It is well known to those who
have made night excursions in mountain countries, that anything
approaching absolute darkness, in places not overshadowed by trees
or rocks, is very unusual. It may be impossible to distinguish one
object from another; but the outline of opaque bodies against the
sky is almost always traceable, and it rarely happens that a path
is not in some degree distinguishable by its lighter hue from the
surrounding rocks or vegetation. On this night, however, nothing
whatever could be seen; and as we knew that the narrow track was
carried for the next three or four miles along a very steep slope,
precipitous in places, we felt that our difficulties were not yet
over. The horses and mules, however, showed themselves deserving of
the confidence placed in them. Ball, who led the way on foot,
feeling his way with an alpenstock, had a narrow escape, as,
misplacing his foot, he fell over the edge, but was luckily stopped
by a dense mass of thorny bushes, from which he was rescued with a
little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span> trouble. We
were heartily glad when, on reaching the spot where the track turns
downward towards the river, we at last saw the lights of our camp
glimmering through the trees. The roof of dark clouds overhead had
by this time grown rather less dense; some faint light helped us
down the steep slope, and a little before eleven o’clock we reached
the welcome shelter of our tents. The case of the wounded soldier
was first attended to. It was much less serious than we supposed;
the eye was not much injured, but there was an ugly flesh wound on
the face below it, where a jagged stem had torn through the upper
part of the cheek. Wounds heal with remarkable readiness among the
natives of this country, and after a few days nothing remained but
a scar on the man’s face. A sheep, several fowls, eggs, and three
large dishes of cooked food were soon forthcoming as the evening
<i>mona</i>, and a rather late supper closed the proceedings of the
day.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">We</span> had at last succeeded in
breaking the charm that seemed to have hitherto kept us from the
inner recesses of the Great Atlas; but we had done little more, and
what we had as yet seen and handled of the vegetation of the higher
region merely served to whet the appetite, and increase our natural
voracity. Our talk on that night of our return to Hasni, and our
first thoughts on the following morning, turned on the possibility
of making the wretched village of Arround our base of operations
for two or three days, as it was clear that only by starting from
that point would it be possible to make a fruitful ascent of the
higher ridges. During the day’s excursion, Hooker had ascertained a
point of great practical importance. While mounting the slopes on
the west flank of the valley, he noticed a path leading upwards
towards a narrow ravine at its head, and learned in answer to his
inquiries that this led to Sous—the great valley on the farther
side of the main range. It was clear then, that, with Arround as a
starting point, we should have the advantage of a beaten track as
far as the crest of the ridge; and, even if this should not be very
high, we might, from that point, ascend one of the adjoining
summits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>The greater part
of the following day, May 14, was devoted to putting our large
collections into order; but meanwhile negotiations for carrying out
our plan of sleeping at Arround were the most pressing business,
and at length, after endless palavers, and discussing countless
difficulties, were brought to the desired conclusion. Almost alone
among the men in authority, whom we met in Marocco, the sheik of
this valley seemed to have no special aversion to us as strangers
and Christians. For very sufficient reasons he was longing for the
moment that should see us and our escort depart from his district;
but meanwhile he seemed anxious to keep on friendly terms, and do
what he could to meet our wishes. We had already made him several
presents; but here, as elsewhere in the country, we found that most
of the articles we had provided for that purpose were little
appreciated. Opera glasses, musical boxes, and even watches are of
small account, unless with the comparatively civilised men who have
lived in the coast towns or the great cities: cutlery is much more
sought after, and some large sheath knives, of which we had a fair
supply, were always highly acceptable; but fire-arms, not
necessarily of modern make, are far more welcome than any other
gifts. On this occasion we resorted to a strange engine of
seduction. Before leaving London, Ball had happened to pick up, in
an old curiosity shop, an antiquated weapon, of the size of a large
horse pistol, with four barrels intended to be loaded and
discharged all together. This, which we had called the ‘young
mitrailleuse,’ had been the subject of many jokes during the
journey, but was now with due solemnity presented to the sheik. The
effect of our munificence was immediate and satisfactory, and the
sheik was gained over to our cause. Fortunately, the efficiency of
the ‘young mitrailleuse’ was not tested while we were in the
country. It may probably have been since employed with deadly
effect; but it is doubtful whether the victim would be
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span> person against
whom the four barrels may have been directed.</p>

<p>The sheik undertook that one of the houses in Arround should be
cleared out for our reception; but, to provide for all
contingencies, we arranged to take with us the two smaller and
lighter tents, along with the usual supply of botanical paper and
tin boxes.</p>

<p>Many natives of both sexes came to our camp during the day, in
quest of medical treatment, as they had done during our absence the
day before; and we were much amused to find that Abraham had coolly
undertaken medical practice on his own account. He had provided
himself with a large bottle of black stuff, containing heaven knows
what nauseous ingredients, and this was doled out impartially to
all applicants. It appeared to be a strong purgative, and may have
answered sufficiently well in the rather frequent cases of
indigestion arising from overeating. Of more serious complaints,
ophthalmia was one of the most prevalent here, as elsewhere
throughout South Marocco. Scrofulous sores and strictures were also
common. Women desirous of offspring were brought to the camp by
their husbands, and some cases of natural deformity also presented
themselves. All seemed to have that great condition for remarkable
cures that depends on a firm faith in the efficacy of the remedy.
We had deliberately refused to follow the example of many African
travellers, by including aphrodisiacs among the drugs carried with
us, and all applications for such were met by a stern refusal.</p>

<p>We found time in the afternoon to examine the vegetation of the
valley in the neighbourhood of our camp, of which we had hitherto
obtained merely a passing view. The general aspect was very much
what may be found at a level lower by 1,200 or 1,400 feet in
Southern Spain or Calabria. In the valley bottom the prevailing
trees were poplars—the common black poplar, and a
small-leaved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
variety of the white poplar—and <i>Salix purpurea</i>, with walnut,
olive, and carob, the latter three being extensively cultivated.
The small-leaved ash, <i>Fraxinus oxyphylla</i>, was also rather
common, but does not grow to so large a size as in North Marocco.
On drier ground, on the stony slopes, <i>Callitris</i> occurs here
and there; and two junipers—<i>J. oxycedrus</i> and <i>J.
phœnicea</i>,—are rather frequent, and when allowed to reach
maturity attain to the stature of small trees. The evergreen oak is
the predominant tree on the flanks of the mountains, and exhibits
several varieties, but rarely attains its natural size. Shrubs and
low bushes, as usual in the Mediterranean region, are very numerous
and varied, most of them, such as the alaternus, phillyrea,
lentisk, oleander, and colutea, being widely diffused species of
Southern Europe; and a beautiful honeysuckle (<i>Lonicera
etrusca</i>), with large, sweet-scented flowers, was a conspicuous
ornament. Along with these, several common forms of Central and
North-western Europe, such as the common bramble, the ivy, the
dog-rose and elder, here find their southern limit. It was not
possible, however, for a botanist to look about him at any spot in
the valley without being struck by abundant evidence that he had
entered a region very distinct from any part of Southern Europe or
Algeria. This impression was strengthened throughout our ride of
the previous day, as we ascended from our camp to the foot of the
ancient moraine, and everywhere saw conspicuous plants peculiar to
the middle and lower zones of the Great Atlas. Our first impression
was that the proportion of such endemic species was larger in this
part of the valley than in the higher zone; but this was due to the
fact, that so many more of those inhabiting the lower zone strike
the eye by their greater size and by the brilliancy of their
flowers. When we came to examine our collections with the requisite
care, we found that about one-seventh of all the species found in
the middle region of this valley is made up of peculiar endemic
species, while the proportion<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_211">[211]</span> of the same element in the higher region
rises to one-fifth.<a id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>We were especially struck by the complete absence of new generic
types. There were, indeed, but two species seen in this valley
belonging to North African genera—<i>Callitris</i> and
<i>Lotononis</i>—that do not extend to Europe. All the rest are
referable to European types, of which the large majority extend to
the central and north-western parts of our continent. No
representatives of tropical and sub-tropical types, such as are
seen in Arabia, Persia, and Northern India, are here to be
found.</p>

<p>During our absence on the 13th, a courier had arrived from
Mogador, with letters from M. Carstensen. The man had first gone to
Marocco, and thence, for the most part following our track, had
found us in our Atlas head-quarters, and was well pleased with the
trifling pay of a few shillings for the journey. To-day another
courier made his appearance, bearing answers to the letter
despatched to El Graoui, on the morning of the 12th, so that we had
no reason to complain of remissness on his part. Probably for the
purpose of shifting an unpopular measure from his own shoulders,
the wary old Governor forwarded a letter from the Viceroy,
expressly sanctioning our stay in the Aït Mesan valley, for as long
a time as should be required for the objects of our journey. Along
with this, El Graoui wrote to Hooker, expressing a hope that our
stay would not be prolonged more than was really necessary,
inasmuch as the villages of the valley were very poor. Further
provision was made to meet Maw’s desire to return to England, and
an order sent that two soldiers should be detached from our escort
to accompany him to Mogador.</p>

<p>It was curious to observe that whenever literary knowledge was
in request, whether for reading and fully understanding letters
addressed to us in Arabic, or for the composition of letters to be
addressed by us in the same language, the member of the expedition
always most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span> relied
upon was Hamed, Ball’s personal attendant, one of the poor fellows
engaged at Mogador to act in a menial capacity and accompany the
expedition on foot. It is true of the western dialect spoken in
Marocco, as well as of the purer Arabic of the east, that a
familiar knowledge of the spoken tongue does not imply a full
acquaintance with the written language, and Abraham was evidently
sometimes at fault. Education, in a literary sense, is not among
Moslems a privilege of rank or wealth, and is quite as often found
among the poorest as with those above them. Our two Kaïds were both
ostentatiously illiterate, and the soldiers knew no more than their
officers; and poor Hamed, alone of all our suite, seemed to be
worth taking into council on these occasions.</p>

<p>Once more the insatiable rapacity of our escort gave us trouble,
and proved to us that the objection to our making a long stay among
these poor mountaineers was not an unreasonable one. We ascertained
that the demands of these shameless fellows on their own behalf,
apart from the rest of the expedition, rose to forty fowls a day,
with bread, tea, and sugar in proportion, while they were
constantly grumbling at the insufficiency of this allowance for ten
persons, and demanding money from the natives in lieu of the other
luxuries to which they thought themselves entitled. We sincerely
regretted our want of power to put a stop to these abuses; but it
was impossible to sacrifice the main object of our journey, and we
merely resolved to acquaint El Graoui with the facts after our
return to Mogador.</p>

<p>We rose early on the morning of the 15th, and lost no time in
preparing for our departure. Just when all seemed ready for a start
a new and serious difficulty arose. Hooker and Maw had both
provided for the journey several large tin cases painted green, and
intended for the transport of living plants from Marocco to
England; and, as a matter of course, some of these were amongst the
luggage packed up for the expedition to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_213">[213]</span> Arround. When the sheik arrived about 7
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span> he at once declared that he had
undertaken to conduct us to Arround, but that to carry the luggage
he saw prepared was utterly out of the question. A long and
vehement controversy ensued; at first it was impossible to
understand the real nature of the difficulty, and when this was
gradually made clear, the objections seemed to us so incoherent and
inconsistent that we suspected them to be mere pretexts to cover
some unavowed obstacle in the sheik’s mind.</p>

<p>It appeared that the tin cases were the real stumbling blocks.
‘When the people of Arround see those cases,’ said Si Hassan,
‘nothing will persuade them that they are not filled with
treasure—they will attack us in the night, and will kill you and me
too, in order to get possession of them.’ ‘They will believe the
boxes to be full of gunpowder’—so ran another version of the
difficulty—‘and think you have come to take possession of their
valley, and will fight to resist your remaining there.’ We
suspected at the time that the unavowed cause of offence lay in the
boxes being painted green—the colour of the Prophet and his
descendants—but from the slight attention paid by the mountaineers
to the observances of Moslem law, even in more important matters,
we afterwards rejected this explanation, and were inclined to
believe that the sheik knew his own people, and truly represented
the strange fancies to which they are subject.</p>

<p>The tin boxes were reluctantly sacrificed, and with them the
possibility of making any large collection of living plants in the
upper region of the Great Atlas. The luggage was repacked, and
after several hours’ delay we started about 10.30 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> by the same track which had been the scene of our
recent night adventure.</p>

<p>The weather during the last two days had been gradually changing
from the condition of ‘set fair’ to which we had been used since
our arrival in Marocco. The barometer had fallen progressively
fully five millimetres,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_214">[214]</span> and the clouds had changed from their
ordinary condition of light, separate fleecy masses gathered round
the higher ridges during the day to a dense canopy stretching
continuously over the visible portion of the sky. If choice had
been left to us we should not have selected this morning for our
excursion; but, after overcoming so many difficulties, there was no
thought of letting weather stand in our way, and we could only
resolve to make the best of it whatever it might be. On this
occasion we had rather more time to spare than two days before, and
we added a good deal to our previous collections in the valley,
though less than we could have done if the precious morning hours
had not been wasted in controversy.</p>

<p>We had many an occasion for admiring the sureness of foot of the
mules and horses in this country; but we also noticed that, like
their fellows elsewhere, they have some peculiarities of
disposition that a traveller should take note of. Maw’s mule,
hitherto remarkably steady, had a trick of keeping to the outer
verge of the path in steep places, and when his head was turned
inward his hind foot would go over the edge. After recovering
himself once or twice, he at last slipped completely. Maw saved
himself in good time, while the animal rolled down the steep slope
towards the torrent. In many places this is so precipitous that the
beast must have been killed; as it was, he was stopped by some
thorny bushes, and was with some trouble got back to the track, a
sadder and a wiser mule for the rest of that day at least. It is
well known that several fatal accidents in the Alps have occurred
in places of the same character from interference with a mule, who
should be left to take his own course. The now almost familiar road
to Arround, with the ascent of the watercourse, seeming more
objectionable each time that we passed it, was accomplished without
further incident, and no other delays than those involved in
plant-collecting. In six hours from Hasni we reached
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span> village, whose
inhabitants had all turned out of doors to gaze on the Christian
strangers who, from some inscrutable motive, had come a second time
to their secluded valley, and now seemed resolved to fix their
abode there.</p>

<p>A house, the best in the village we were told, had been prepared
for us by the simple process of turning out its inmates, and to
this we were at once conducted. On the ground floor were two quite
dark and low cellars or</p>

<div class="figcenter iw2">
<figure class="iw2" id="i10"><img src='images/i10.jpg' alt=''>
<p>HOUSES AT ARROUND.</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p class="nind">dens, seemingly filthy, but which we were not
inclined to explore. Ascending by some rickety steps, we reached
the upper floor, the larger part of which was occupied by a rude
open verandah, at each end of which was a little closet about seven
feet square, one of which was occupied by Maw, while the other was
used as a kitchen, the open verandah serving as our sitting-room,
and as night quarters for Hooker and Ball. As usual in the Shelluh
houses, the doors were only about four feet, and the rooms and
verandah<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> not over
five feet high, making it inconvenient for us to move about. In
most of the houses there are underground cellars to which the
inhabitants retire in winter, as is the custom in Armenia and in
some of the higher valleys of the French Alps.</p>

<p>We scarcely had been settled in the house when several
applicants for medical advice presented themselves; but these were
disposed of soon enough to leave some remaining daylight, which was
devoted to a stroll up the left, or SE. branch of the upper valley.
The flat ground was parcelled into small fields divided by stone
dykes, and intersected by slender irrigation channels. The fields
seemed to be carefully tilled, rye, barley, and beans being the
only crop now above ground. Maize is sown in the latter part of May
and ripens in the course of six weeks. We saw with surprise a few
vines in this inclement spot, and also Madder (<i>Rubia
tinctorum</i>) seemingly wild, but doubtless originally introduced
for native use.</p>

<p>The mountains, as far as we could see them, looked forbidding,
and the scene this evening was even more sombre than it had been
two days before. Leaden clouds roofed the valley across, and
completely hid the higher ridges; slight gusts of chilling wind
blew at intervals, and all the tokens of impending bad weather
warned us not to indulge in cheerful anticipations for the morrow.
On this occasion we had limited our escort to two soldiers, whose
presence showed that we were under the shadow of imperial
protection, but who would doubtless have been utterly useless if
the natives had harboured hostile designs. Of such, however, there
was not the slightest indication. The demeanour of the people was
respectful and friendly, rather than the reverse. Our every
movement was watched, but from a distance, and there was none of
the intrusive curiosity so often complained of by travellers among
semi-barbarous people. The men all habitually wear the hooded
cloak, of dark-coloured goat’s hair, somewhat looser than the
Moorish <i>jellabia</i>, which appears to be<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_217">[217]</span> peculiar to the tribes of the Great
Atlas. Whether the slight variations in the triangular patch of
coloured stuff with rude embroidery that is inserted at the back,
serves to distinguish the men of one tribe from another, we failed
to ascertain. The women, who make but a faint show of concealing
half the face when approaching strangers, seemed to be rather
better favoured than those we had seen in the lower valley. They
partly shave the head, and twine the remaining hair into two broad
plaits, bringing these forward crosswise over the forehead.</p>

<p>With a view to possible difficulties arising with the sheik, we
had taken Abraham with us, leaving the camp at Hasni for
twenty-four hours in charge of Crump, Hooker’s English attendant;
but it was arranged that the former was to return on the following
morning, much to his own satisfaction, as the cold and discomfort
of this Alpine village seemed to make both him and the Marocco
soldiers perfectly miserable.</p>

<p>Our evening meal was enlivened by one of some precious bottles
of generous wine that Maw had added to our stores, reserved for
special occasions, such as the present. After this we should gladly
have gone to sleep, if stern duty had not forbidden any such
luxury. The minimum of evening work for the travelling botanist is
to lay out between dry paper the contents of his boxes and
portfolios filled during the day. On this occasion the operation
was more troublesome than usual, as we struggled to screen our
single flickering candle from the night wind in the least exposed
corner of the verandah, and midnight had come and gone before we
stretched our mattresses on the earthen floor, first duly dusted
with insect powder, and sought rest. In our exposed position the
cold was very sensible through the night, though the thermometer
did not fall below 45° Fahr.</p>

<p>The morning sky was so gloomy that no one awoke so early as we
had intended; and at sunrise on May 16, when we loudly called for
breakfast, the light was still so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_218">[218]</span> imperfect that it seemed as though the day
had but just dawned. There was less than the usual delay; but six
o’clock had passed, and we were not yet ready to start. To our
great satisfaction we found that the sheik did not propose to
accompany us to-day, but had appointed two men of the village to
act as guides. With these, and our usual personal attendants, whom
we knew by experience to be active pedestrians, we started about
6.30 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> to ascend the main southern
branch of the valley. For rather more than a mile the way over the
filled-up bed of the old moraine lake is quite flat, and for a
considerable distance beyond this the ascent along the bottom of
the valley is very gentle; but we were led by the aspect of the
ground to ascend the rather steep western slope at a part much
farther from the village than we had traversed three days
before.</p>

<p>Our inducement to leave the track was the wish to examine
certain solitary trees that we noticed scattered at rather wide
intervals on the slopes, nowhere descending below the level of
8,000 feet above the sea, but extending upwards, where they find a
resting place, through a vertical zone of about 1,500 feet. The
first we were able to reach, which was similar in aspect to the
rest, showed a trunk more than two feet in diameter, and about
thirty feet high, but broken off and shattered at the top; the
branches, with their very dark foliage, diminishing in length
upwards, give the whole a conical form. We took it at the time for
<i>Juniperus phœnicea</i>, which is rather a common tree in the
lower valleys. Subsequent examination showed it, however, to differ
from that species, and to be identical with <i>Juniperus
thurifera</i>, a tree hitherto known only in Central Spain,
Portugal, and Algeria, and apparently nowhere common. From the
number of dead stems seen, it seems to have once girdled this mass
of the Atlas with a belt of forest, which has been gradually
thinned, and is doomed to ultimate destruction. The existing trees
are probably of high antiquity, and their destruction is
mainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span> due to the
practice of setting fire to the brushwood to gain pasture for
animals; while the young plants, of which not a single one was
seen, would be cut off while yet seedlings by the tooth of the
goat, the great enemy of tree vegetation—an animal whose disastrous
influence, acting indirectly on the climate of wide regions,
entitles it to rank as one of the worst enemies of the human
race.</p>

<p>Although the ground was to a great extent occupied by the two
dwarf bushes seen on our first visit, <i>Alyssum spinosum</i> and
<i>Bupleurum spinosum</i>, there was no lack of new forms of plants
to maintain our enthusiasm; and, in spite of the desire to push on,
many a halt occurred as one or other lighted on an object of fresh
interest. As a natural consequence of our having chosen to make our
way along the side of the glen, instead of following its bed, we
had to cross several projecting spurs, the last rather steep,
before descending to a spot where, at the extreme head of the
valley, our guides pointed out a Saint’s tomb, consisting of a rude
stone hut with a space five or six feet square in the centre. When
we reached this, the guides made it clear to us that we had arrived
at the end of our excursion. The hut stands at the junction of the
streams issuing from two rocky ravines. That on the west side was
apparently very steep and pathless; the other, mounting about due
S., was nearly equally steep, but we could see that a beaten track
ascended along the opposite bank of the slender torrent that
tumbled over the rocks at its entrance. The native guides confirmed
the statement before made to Hooker, that by that tract lay the way
to Sous; but, by expressive pantomime, they explained that danger
lay in that direction, and that the people of the other side were
addicted to the practice of shooting at strangers. We were careful
to avoid controversy, and set ourselves to collect plants in a
patch of boggy ground near the hut, where familiar northern
species, such as <i>Stellaria uliginosa</i>, <i>Sagina Linnæi</i>,
<i>Montia fontana</i> and <i>Veronica Beccabunga</i>, grew in
company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span> with a new
species of <i>Nasturtium</i>, and others not before seen by us.</p>

<p>So intent had we been on the surrounding vegetation, that we had
scarcely cast a glance at the sky overhead. This had continually
assumed a more and more gloomy aspect; and at length, after due
notice and preparation, the long-expected rain began, not in a
heavy downpour such as often occurs in southern countries, but in
that fine steady drizzle which is known to those whom the fates
have led to the northern parts of our island as a Scotch mist,
hateful to the lover of the picturesque and still more hateful to
the botanist. On this occasion, however, it seemed to us no unmixed
evil, as it furthered the execution of a stratagem that was already
in our minds. Our followers were scantily clad, and felt more than
we did the chilly temperature of the day, and of course the rain
increased their discomfort. They were, therefore, in the right
frame of mind to accept at once the suggestion that they should
light a fire within the hut, therein following the example of
preceding wayfarers. After muttering a few prayers, they proceeded
to gather some damp sticks, and presently were busy in the attempt
to make a fire out of them. Having continued for a few minutes to
loiter about, still gathering plants near the hut, until the men
appeared to be fully engrossed in their occupation, we started
together to ascend the track leading to the summit ridge of the
Atlas.</p>

<p>We had reached the Saint’s tomb about 9 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span>, and found its height above the sea-level to be
7,852 feet (2,393·2 m.). Little more than half-an-hour had since
elapsed, so that, if no unexpected difficulty occurred, there was
ample time to reach the summit of the pass which, as we thought,
could scarcely be 3,000 feet above us. A number of interesting
plants soon rewarded our adventure, and delayed us for a while on
the rocky banks of the torrent near the bottom of the ravine, but
out of view of the Saint’s tomb. On joining the track, we found it
a well-made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
mountain path, constructed with some skill, advantage being taken
of the nature of the ground to make zigzags, evidently intended for
the passage of beasts of burthen.</p>

<p>We had ascended several hundred feet, and were looking about for
plants among rocks to the left of the path, when some faint sound
made us look up, and we descried, amid the rain and mist, a party
of men and laden mules descending towards us down the steep ravine.
There was some obvious awkwardness in the impending encounter of
three Englishmen, utterly ignorant of the native tongue, with a set
of wild mountaineers of the Atlas, in a spot where no stranger had
ever before been seen. In such cases, the less time that is left
for deliberation the better. Suspicion or greed may prompt an
attack where time is left for consultation; but if people are
suddenly confronted by peaceable strangers, they will rarely,
unless robbers by profession, think of molesting them. The shape of
the ground happened to favour this obvious bit of policy, and some
projecting rocks concealed the approaching train until we suddenly
confronted them at a turn of the path, and passed within a few
yards, with something approaching to a grave salute. The mules
appeared to be laden with goat-skins, along with other articles
that we could not distinguish. Whether these were people from the
northern side of the chain returning from a trading expedition in
the Sous country, or men of Sous carrying goods to the capital, we
never certainly ascertained; but, from noticing pieces of
orange-peel on the track, we inferred that they must have descended
rather low in the Sous valley; while it is certain that people
going from the lower part of that valley to the city of Marocco
would not have followed this circuitous and difficult track, unless
urged by special reasons.</p>

<p>A little farther on we found, on ledges of rock near the track,
several of the most interesting plants seen during the day.
Thenceforward all botanising became difficult.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_222">[222]</span> The rain turned to sleet, and before
long to snow; and, though the roughness of the ground still enabled
us to discern the more conspicuous plants, it was almost impossible
to secure satisfactory specimens.</p>

<p>Soon after the snow had set in, we heard, from below, yells and
screams, and immediately guessed that the caravan from Sous had
brought news to our guides at the Saint’s tomb of our escapade
towards the summit of the pass. The guess was correct; and though
we pushed on rather faster than before, the foremost guide soon
overtook us, and addressing himself especially to Maw, who led the
way during the ascent, with vehement gestures and emphatic phrases,
that seemed to combine threats and injunctions with supplication,
urged an immediate return. Maw judiciously had recourse to an
argument of universal efficacy, and, presenting the man with a
piece of silver, pointed upwards and strove to explain, by signs,
that we meant to go to the top and then return. Shortly afterwards,
the second man appeared, panting from the pace at which he had run
up the steep ascent. He addressed himself to Ball, who came next to
Maw, but was answered by the same reasoning that had prevailed with
his companion.</p>

<p>The upper part of the ravine was wider than it had been below,
and the slope rather less steep. Here, as throughout the upper
valley, porphyries and porphyritic tuffs of a prevailing red
colour, form the mass of the ridge; but we observed at several
points intrusive masses of diorite, sometimes much resembling
granite in appearance. Higher up, near the summit of the ridge, Maw
noticed white crystalline limestone, of no great extent, which
appeared to be intercalated with the porphyrites.</p>

<p>To collect plants was now scarcely possible, for the snow
covered the surface, and it was necessary to kick it away from the
tufts of grass or dwarf bushes, in order to ascertain what might be
growing beneath. The wind, which had hitherto spared us, now joined
itself to the opposing forces, driving the snow with blinding
force, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> making
the cold, already severe, well nigh intolerable. The poor fellows
who had for some way followed us without further remonstrance, now
renewed with redoubled energy their appeal that we should return.
Kissing the hem of our coats at one moment, brandishing their arms
with passionate gestures, or actually pulling us back at another,
they really impressed us more by their pitiable appearance, exposed
with the slightest covering to the bitter blast, their feet and
bare legs cut and bleeding from the rocks and thorny bushes of the
way.</p>

<p>It was now apparent that the dread with which these men were
evidently impressed did not arise solely from apprehension of an
encounter with human enemies. Firmly believing that the heights of
the Atlas are inhabited by <i>djinns</i>, or demons, it was obvious
to our companions that the storm was caused by their anger at the
intrusion of strangers into their sanctuary. We had not before
noticed that one of the Shelluhs carried with him a live cock under
his arm. In a state of the utmost excitement, he now proceeded to
cut the animal’s throat, in order thus to appease the wrath of our
supernatural foes, then renewing the appeal to us to forego further
provocation.</p>

<p>In emphatic English, and such pantomime as we could command, we
explained that we were determined to reach the top, but would then
immediately return, and proceeded to face the last portion of the
ascent. This lay through a broad <i>couloir</i>, some twenty to
thirty feet wide, between steep walls of rock where, on narrow
ledges giving scarcely any hold for snow, the last plants were
collected. The storm, now almost a hurricane, raged with increasing
violence; it was scarcely possible to face it, and our hands and
feet gave scarcely any token of sensation. The thermometer, though
carried in a pocket, marked 25° Fahr. (or about -4° Cent.) when
last observed. Maw pushed on with increasing vigour, and, in the
driving snow, was soon lost to sight. Presently, shouts were heard,
and he reappeared, saying that he had reached the ridge where
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> ground fell
away on the southern side, that he could see absolutely nothing in
any direction, and, owing to the severity of the cold, found it
impossible to remain. He estimated the height at rather more than
one hundred feet above the point reached by Ball, who in turn was
about sixty feet above Hooker. They descended through that short
space; and, after very brief deliberation, decided that no more
could be done, and that a speedy descent was the only possible
course. The appearance of the party was singular, and not one could
have been recognised by his nearest friends. Faces of a livid
purple tint were enclosed by masses of hair thickly matted with
ice, and the beards, frozen in the direction of the wind, projected
on one side, giving a strangely distorted expression to each
countenance.</p>

<p>After observing the aneroid barometer at the point which we
estimated at 200 feet below the summit, and glancing at our
watches, which marked about 2.30 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, we
turned downwards, and set out as fast as our legs would carry us,
cutting across the zigzag track now deeply covered with snow.
Before long we got shelter from the violence of the wind, and began
to feel the tingling of returning circulation in the hands and
feet. In places the ground was steep enough to require a little
caution in traversing the rocky slopes, partly grown over by tufted
bushes, all now veiled in fresh snow; but little delay ensued, and
in less than two hours we reached the bottom of the ravine where
the track passes close to the Saint’s tomb. The shouts of our
Shelluh guides had announced our approach, and we were met by the
smiling faces of our Mogador attendants, who had judiciously made
themselves as comfortable as circumstances permitted by keeping up
a fire in the hut.</p>

<p>In the valley little snow had fallen, and that was half melted,
and continued to fall in that intermediate condition between snow
and rain that forms slush, a word of odious import except for its
associations with the Christmas<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_225">[225]</span> holidays. We learned that the sheik, Si
Hassan, was waiting for us some way lower down in the valley, and
without halting we pushed on to meet him. Long waiting in cold and
wet does not mend any man’s temper, and the sheik, already much
annoyed that his injunctions not to let us go beyond the Saint’s
tomb had been ineffectual, was doubtless in a savage humour when we
at length appeared, after successfully breaking through all the
restraints he had contrived. Yet he managed to put a good face on
the matter, offered his congratulations on our safe return, and
invited us to partake of some food that was provided in a spot
where an overhanging rock gave partial shelter. This did not save
the poor fellows who had done their best to keep us within the
intended limit from a desperate ‘blowing-up,’ and many threats of
future vengeance. Drenched and cold as we were, the invitation to
halt was anything but tempting; but in this country the obligations
of hospitality are binding on the receiver as well as the giver,
and it was necessary to wait some time and eat a few mouthfuls
before proceeding on our homeward way to Arround.</p>

<p>As we approached the village, we witnessed a marvellous
exhibition of colour that, even in our weather-beaten condition,
impressed us with admiration. The steep ridges enclosing the valley
were now thickly powdered with snow, but almost concealed from view
by the clouds that hung low over our heads. Towards sunset these
gradually rose up and melted into mist, and the whole scene was
transfused with a delicate sea-green hue that seemed bright by
contrast with the sombre tints in which we had been enveloped
during the day. It often happens in bad weather that as the distant
horizon is lit up towards sunset the rays, travelling under the
dense strata of cloud that cover a mountain district, produce at
that hour the effect of sudden illumination; but whether the green
tint on this occasion was due to a similar colour in the
distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span> horizon,
unseen by us, or was complementary to the prevailing red colour of
the surrounding rocks, we were unable to decide.</p>

<p>About sunset we reached our house at Arround. The open verandah
on this chilly evening, with the thermometer little over 40° Fahr.,
was not the most comfortable place for the evening toilet, nor for
working in after supper. Under ordinary circumstances, two at least
of the party would infallibly have been laid up with heavy colds or
worse; but the last three weeks of open-air life in this fine
climate had put us all into excellent condition. A moderate supper
was despatched with general satisfaction, and no one suffered
further inconvenience from the roughness of the day or the coldness
of the night.</p>

<p>As might have been expected from the unsettled state of the
weather, the observations taken to determine the altitude of
Arround had not been quite satisfactory. The heights deduced from
comparison with Mogador, where the weather was also unsettled, were
discordant to the extent of about 80 feet. A comparison of
observations taken here and at Hasni, on the 13th and 15th inst.,
with a few hours’ interval, gave a much nearer agreement; and the
mean of these, being 6,463 feet (1,970 m.), is that which we have
adopted. A boiling-water observation at 8 <span class=
"sc2">P.M.</span> in the evening, with the temperature of the air
at 40° Fahr., gave a result higher by 20 feet; but it helps to show
that the probable error is not large.</p>

<p>The answers to our inquiries as to the Pass reached during the
day were, as we had reason to believe, designedly vague and
indefinite. It appears to be known as Tagherot, and to serve for
communication with Tifinout, which is the name of a mountain
district with one or more large villages, whose drainage is carried
to the Sous. The main valley of the Sous must, however, lie to the
south of Tifinout, and extend much farther east. Our corrected
results make the point at which our last observation was taken,
4,821 feet above Arround,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_227">[227]</span> giving for the Tagherot Pass 5,021 feet
above Arround, or 11,484 feet (3,500·4 m.) above the sea.</p>

<p>In <a href="#apa">Appendix A</a> the reasons which showed the
necessity for a considerable correction to the original
observations made since our arrival at Mogador are fully explained.
The difference in the resulting heights throughout our journey is
not of much moment as regards the lower stations; but it increases
rapidly with increasing altitude, and in the case of the Tagherot
Pass amounts to about 500 feet. As this correction was disclosed
only after careful examination and comparison of all the
observations, the first result, which was derived from the rough
reduction made at the time, communicated in a letter from Hooker to
the late Sir Roderick Murchison,<a id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and which appeared in other
published notices of our journey, is probably erroneous to the
extent above mentioned.</p>

<p>Assuming our final results to be pretty nearly correct, and
having been unable to hear of any other easy or frequented pass in
this part of the range, we seem to be justified in concluding that
this section of the Great Atlas chain, as compared with any of the
mountain systems of Europe, maintains a remarkably high mean level.
The height of the projecting summits in the adjoining portions of
the chain was variously estimated by us at 1,500 or 2,000 feet
above the Tagherot Pass. Taking the lower of these estimates, and
assuming the other depressions to be no higher than Tagherot, we
should have for the mean height of the main ridge at least 12,200
feet. Judging from all the distant views we were able to obtain,
the portion of the Atlas chain near the head of the Aït Mesan
valley is very similar in character to that extending eastward to
the sources of the Oued Tessout, and does not reach a higher
elevation. If this opinion be well founded, we have in this part of
the Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> Atlas a
range, fully 80 miles in length, which in its mean elevation
surpasses any other of equal length in Europe, or in the countries
bordering on the Mediterranean. The chain of the Pennine Alps, from
the Col de Bonhomme to the Simplon, alone approaches the same
limit, as, excluding those limiting passes, the mean elevation of
the dividing ridge for a distance of over 90 miles is about 11,800
English feet. That of the Mont Blanc range, from the Cime des Fours
to the Pointe d’Orny, probably equals the mean height of the Great
Atlas, being about 12,300 feet, but this is only about 25 miles in
length. Excluding the mountains of Central Asia, and the Andes of
Bolivia and Peru, neither of which can be spoken of as mountain
chains in the ordinary sense, the only considerable range
surpassing the Atlas in height is the higher part of the Caucasus,
between the peaks of Elbruz and Kasbek, whose mean height, for a
distance exceeding 110 miles, must reach, if it does not surpass,
the limit of 13,000 feet.</p>

<p>Our usual evening occupation was pursued under greater
difficulties than usual. There was not much wind; but the cold was
severely felt in the open verandah, and the portion of our day’s
harvest that was gathered in a wet state had to be left till the
morning’s light should enable us to give our specimens the
requisite treatment.</p>

<p>Our design, not disclosed to any of our native followers, had
been to remain another day at Arround, and, if circumstances were
favourable, to ascend some projecting point in the range that
should command a panoramic view. We had, however, scarcely opened
our eyes on the morning of May 17 when we clearly perceived that
the fates had decided against our scheme. Snow had fallen steadily
during the night, and both branches of the valley above the village
were thickly covered. The sky overhead was of the same leaden
complexion as that of the previous day, and flakes of snow falling
slowly showed that the disposition of the weather continued
unchanged.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> The
continuous fall of the barometer for three days before the rain set
in had prepared us for a persistent fit of bad weather; so we were
less disappointed than we should otherwise have been, and
acquiesced as a matter of course in the preparations for our
departure.</p>

<p>The natives still flocked to the entrance of our house, seeking
medical advice from the Christian <i>hakim</i>. When these had been
disposed of, and all seemed ready for our departure, an unexpected
incident occurred. Eight or ten women, dragging with them a sheep,
entered the house in a tumultuous way, crowding up the stairs and
into the verandah, addressed vehement entreaties to Hooker, and
suddenly cut the sheep’s throat in his presence. Then followed more
passionate entreaties, a document was thrust into his hand, and we
were left at a loss to guess the meaning of the strange scene. At
length, through Ambak’s increasing skill as interpreter, the matter
was made sufficiently clear. A number of men of the village, the
husbands or fathers of our suppliants, had been carried off as
prisoners to Marocco, for non-payment of taxes, and were there
confined in the horrible subterranean dungeons that serve as
prisons. The object of these poor women was to obtain from El
Graoui an order for their release, through the intercession of
Hooker. A promise to do what was possible on their behalf was
readily given; but, although a courteous answer was afterwards sent
through the consul at Mogador, it may be feared that little
attention was paid by the powerful Governor of this region to the
representations of Christian strangers.</p>

<p>The state of the prisons in Marocco is one of many scandals that
disgrace the administration of this country, though an apologist
might suggest that in this respect Marocco is only a century or two
behind the most civilised States of Europe, and not thirty years
behind the late kingdom of Naples. When in the city of Marocco, we
were told that about 4,000 prisoners, of whom the large majority
were unlucky peasants, unable or unwilling to pay
taxes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> were
confined in dungeons. Criminals who have committed murders and
robberies frequently escape by taking refuge at some of the
numerous sanctuaries scattered over the whole territory, while
lesser offenders and mere defaulters are caught wholesale. No food
is provided for prisoners by the authorities; but the means of
keeping body and soul together are generally forthcoming, through
the kindness of relatives, or the charitable feeling which is
common here, as in other Mohammedan countries.</p>

<p>The survival among the Bereber tribes of the practice of
sacrificing an animal to propitiate the favour of a man in
authority, is a fact deserving the attention of ethnologists.
Another instance of a similar kind came to our knowledge a few
weeks later, and we had recently seen that the same rite is
observed to avert the displeasure of evil spirits.</p>

<p>Our increased acquaintance with the flora of the Great Atlas did
not much modify our first impressions. Making due allowance for the
earliness of the season, and for the adverse conditions that may
have concealed from us some species inhabiting the higher zone, it
was clear that the vegetation here differs very much from that of
all the lofty mountain masses of Southern Europe and Western Asia,
and especially in the absence of those families that elsewhere form
the chief ornaments of the higher mountain zone, and which we are
accustomed to associate with the glories of the Alpine flora. There
was here to be seen no gentian, no primrose or <i>Androsace</i>, no
rhododendron, no anemone, no potentilla, and none but lowland forms
of saxifrage and ranunculus.</p>

<p>Our first impression had been that the flora is absolutely very
poor; but this was due mainly to the fact that so large a
proportion of the plants have inconspicuous flowers. Comparing the
produce of our day’s work with that of high mountain excursions
made elsewhere, the species are not deficient in variety, but show
a singularly small proportion of showy flowers. As regards novelty,
we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> had nothing to
complain of; for, in the upper part of this valley, out of 151
species collected, 31 are described as new; and, so far as we know,
are peculiar to the Great Atlas chain. This gives about the same
proportion of endemic species as the Sierra Nevada of Granada,
always regarded as a singularly rich botanical district.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature of the flora of this region, is,
undoubtedly, the very large proportion of common plants of the
colder temperate region (Central and North-Western Europe), here
found associated with species of very different type. Nearly
one-half (70 out of 151) of the species found in the upper zone,
belong to this category, and the proportion is here actually larger
than it is in the higher mountains of Southern Spain. It was
further remarkable that several of these northern species, such as
the wild gooseberry, are plants that do not extend to the South of
Spain, although climatal conditions must be at least equally
favourable, and whose nearest known habitat is six or seven hundred
miles distant. Especially to be noted was the fact that, with the
doubtful exception of <i>Sagina Linnæi</i> (the <i>Spergula
saginoides</i> of the older botanists), not one of the plants in
question is characteristically an Alpine species, or typical of the
Arctic or glacial flora. Combining this with the almost complete
absence of rushes and sedges, we are forced to conclude that,
whatever agencies may have contributed to make up the existing
flora of the Great Atlas, transport by floating ice during the last
glacial period cannot have been amongst them. If such ice-rafts
were ever borne to what was then probably a long western peninsula
of Northern Africa, they must either have foundered at sea with all
their vegetable crew, or, if cast ashore, must have found an
inhospitable region where the voyagers were starved, and left no
descendants.</p>

<p>As was to be expected, from the habitual dryness of the climate,
ferns were here deficient in number and variety. In the upper
region we found very sparingly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_232">[232]</span> six of the common species of Northern
Europe; and lower down, in the middle part of the valley, we were
able to add to our lists but two southern forms.</p>

<p>About one-third only of the species found in the upper-region
could be described as properly belonging to the Mediterranean
flora; most of these being widely-spread plants, while a few are
exclusively confined to the nearest neighbouring mountain
regions—the Lesser Atlas of Algeria or the mountains of Southern
Spain. But there was little in the general aspect of the vegetation
to suggest any special connection with either; and several of the
conspicuous plants have been hitherto known only in very distant
regions. A bright-flowered <i>Veronica</i> appeared to be no more
than a large variety of a species peculiar to Asia Minor;
<i>Medicago suffruticosa</i> had hitherto been seen only in the
Pyrenees; and <i>Evax Heldreichii</i> had been detected nowhere
nearer than the mountains of Sicily and Eastern Algeria. Our
original expectation of finding some connecting links between the
special flora of the Canary Islands and that of North Africa was so
far completely negatived, and we saw nothing to suggest their
existence.</p>

<p>The most prominent characteristics of the mountain flora of the
Great Atlas were found to be of a negative character. If asked to
point out the positive features that most struck us, we should in
the first place note the prevalence of <i>Cruciferæ</i> and
<i>Caryophylleæ</i>, the former reckoning one-ninth and the latter
one-tenth of the whole number of flowering plants. Of conspicuous
genera we had especially remarked <i>Chrysanthemum</i>,
<i>Galium</i>, and <i>Linaria</i>. Of the first of these we found
two new species, one of which, from its remarkable buff-coloured
rays and large scarious involucres, has been named <i>Chrysanthemum
Catananche</i>.</p>

<p>The state of the weather and the earliness of the season may
partially account for the scarcity of animal life in the upper part
of the Aït Mesan valley; but, from all we<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_233">[233]</span> could learn, this appears to be a
characteristic feature of the Great Atlas. The lion is said to
exist in the lower valleys, and especially in Sous, but we were led
to suspect that the animal so called by the natives is the leopard.
The lion undoubtedly exists in the low country, but appears to be
now rare. Those sent as presents from the Sultan to crowned heads
have generally been taken in the valleys east of Fez. The only one
of the Carnivora seen by us was a rather large creature, resembling
a civet in form, but with no markings on the yellowish brown fur,
once seen near our camp at Hasni. Birds were remarkably scarce, and
the only conspicuous kind observed near enough to be identified
much resembled the red-legged partridge, and was seen at a height
of from 9,000 to 10,000 feet in the ascent to the Tagherot Pass.
Instead of going in pairs, as that species is used to do, these
formed a small covey. A single scorpion, of large size, seemingly
of the species common in the low country, was found under a stone
by Maw. Of the numerous reptiles that abound about the skirts of
the mountain range, few, except lizards, seem to frequent the
interior valleys; and the latter are wanting, or at least rare, in
the higher region. Insects were also infrequent, and none were
found under stones above the level of 9,000 feet.</p>

<p>Our brief stay among the Shelluhs in this valley helped to
confirm our previous impression that they form the best element in
the population of Marocco. How much of this superiority is due to
race, and how much to the conditions of existence in a mountain
country, where steady labour is indispensable, may be a question
for discussion; but as the same is also apparent among the people
long settled in the low country at the foot of the mountains, it
may be inferred that the inherited qualities of the mountain tribes
are not speedily lost when they are subjected to altered
conditions. We are told by Rohlfs that on the northern skirts of
the Marocco Sahara the Shelluhs have adopted a predatory life, and
are the most dreaded of all the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_234">[234]</span> wandering robbers of that region. But when
we learn that all the fertile oases of the Sahara have been
monopolised by a small class of Arab descent, who rest their claims
on religious authority, it is not apparent that there is any
alternative for those who do not belong to the privileged class;
and, under such an anomalous condition of society, the energy of
the superior race will show itself in robbery, where that becomes
the only means of obtaining a livelihood. To judge from what we saw
of the country, the best thing that could happen for Marocco would
be the substitution for the Moorish government of an authority
strong enough to keep the Bereber tribes from intestine feuds, and
intelligent enough to leave them a large measure of
self-government, under a moderate and just fiscal system. Gradual
extension of irrigation works would fit for cultivation large
tracts now unproductive, and the superfluous population of the
mountain valleys would spread into the plains, and develop the
latent resources of the country. If it be said that the gradual
diffusion of more intelligent ideas of government may gradually
draw the Sultans of Marocco into the path of progress, and thus
effect without violence as rapid an advance as is compatible with
the ideas and character of the native population, the answer seems
to be that this supposition is not probable in itself, and is not
justified by experience.</p>

<p>For over a thousand years since the date of the Saracen conquest
the two races that make up the population have remained perfectly
distinct. The gradual extension of the central authority may have
done something for the maintenance of external tranquillity, but it
has been marked by a general and persistent decline in the
prosperity of the country. It suffices to read the description
given by Leo Africanus, himself a Moor, of the numerous large and
thriving towns visited by him in the early years of the sixteenth
century, just at the time when they were brought under the rule of
the Moorish Sultans, to measure the vast falling off that has since
followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>The Moorish
government is marked by two fatal defects, from which it seems
unlikely to free itself. That religious fanaticism should have
taken deep root in a country long exposed to the attacks of not
less fanatical enemies was quite inevitable; but for two centuries
there has been peace with Portugal, and the brief Spanish war in
1861 does not seem to have much altered the state of feeling as to
Europeans; yet the hatred to Christians as such seems to be quite
as strong among the Moors at this day as at any former period, and
while it exists must continue to be a serious barrier to industrial
progress. Among the Shelluhs fanaticism has evidently no deep hold
on the people. Some of the chiefs may share, or affect to share, in
what they doubtless consider the tone of good society among the
rulers of the country; but our experience of the people agrees with
that of Jackson, who lived for some time near Agadir, and found
there a positive desire among the people of all classes that he
should establish himself permanently among them.</p>

<p>More serious even than fanaticism, as an obstacle to good
government, is the seeming incapacity of the Moor to estimate any
but immediate results, or to make any effort of which the good
effect will not be very speedily visible. To prove to a Sultan of
Marocco that such a public work or other improvement would double
his revenue at the end of twenty or thirty years would be sheer
waste of breath. It would never occur to a Moor that a benefit so
distant, however great, was worth the slightest present exertion.
Hence the utter neglect of public works, of mineral wealth, and of
the forests which should be an abundant source of national
wealth.</p>

<p>We were somewhat surprised to find among the Aït Mesan people, a
decided taste for ornament, of which no trace is perceptible among
the Arabs of the low country. We noticed that the lintels of the
doors at Arround were decorated with rude carving in geometrical
patterns, diamonds, circles, and triangles. Saddlecloths had
similar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> chequered
patterns in black and white, reminding Hooker of fabrics made by
the Lepchas in Sikkim.</p>

<p>We had scarcely started to descend the valley when it began to
sleet. As soon as we reached the village below, this turned to
rain, which continued with little intermission throughout the day.
The halt for luncheon offered little attraction to any of the
party, and was curtailed as much as possible. It is a proof of the
variety of the vegetation, that although we had already twice
passed through the valley, and made considerable collections, we
noticed on this occasion two or three plants growing close to the
path which none of us had before seen.</p>

<p>A little anxiety was felt as to the ford in the river; and in
truth it was a piece of good fortune that the weather had been so
cold, and that snow instead of rain had fallen on the mountains. A
slight rise of the stream must make the ford impassable. We might
have made our way on foot along the E. side of the valley, though
this appears pathless below the ford, and discovered some way for
passing the stream lower down; but our baggage and precious
collections could scarcely have followed that way, and practically
we should have been prisoners for several days. As it was, the
water at the ford was no higher than usual; the increased supply
from the lower slopes was doubtless compensated by the cutting off
of the drainage of the upper region, now deeply covered with
snow.</p>

<p>Soon after crossing the stream, we were met by Abraham, dressed
in his best, who in this valley assumed quite a lofty air. He
informed us, with a tone of great elation, that the country people
took him for a sherreeff, and, had come out to ask a Jew for his
blessing. The path was in places very slippery, and it was
impossible to travel fast, and so it happened that the daylight was
beginning to fade when we returned to our camp. This displayed a
doleful spectacle. After more than twenty-four hours’ rain the
piece of flat ground which we had selected was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_237">[237]</span> turned into a large pool of slippery
mud. Hooker’s tent had been left standing; but the wet had worked
its way inside, and there was scarcely a dry spot to be found,
while there was no choice but to pitch the smaller tents in the
midst of the general sludge. In such a case the best plan is to
make a floor of branches and leafy twigs, and the carob trees that
grew close at hand were at once requisitioned for the purpose. The
Alpine Club tent, though the canvas was wet, when set over this
rough flooring, afforded very tolerable shelter and freedom from
the all-pervading mud.</p>

<p>The advantages of this tent were further proved during the
night. When pitched in open ground it depends, like every other
tent, on such support as tent pegs can give; but when trees are at
hand the supporting rope can be rigged fore and aft in such a way
as to defy any storm to upset it. During the night a furious gale
arose, as it seemed, quite suddenly, accompanied by torrents of
rain; the tent pegs were drawn out of the muddy soil; and twice
Hooker’s tent fell bodily to the ground, luckily with no other bad
result than to envelop the sleeper in the clammy folds of the wet
canvas. The soldiers contrived to keep their tent standing; but
those who mounted guard, and the natives sent by the sheik for the
same duty, must have passed a miserable night. The excitement
caused by the falling of the tent, when the whole camp turned out
with loud outcries, must have been welcome as a relief from the
dreariness of the time.</p>

<p>The storm of the night marked the end of the bad weather, and
the morning of the 18th brought back to us the clear air and blue
sky to which we had been hitherto accustomed, and which rarely left
us during the remainder of our journey. The morning hours were
fully occupied, and the short time we could spare for examining the
low ground near our camp enabled us to add several species to our
lists. Having packed up our collections in tolerable condition,
notwithstanding all the difficulties of the last<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span> few days, we made ready to
start a little before mid-day, having arranged for a short day’s
journey.</p>

<p>The vegetation of this valley offers so many points of interest
that it has seemed better to reserve a fuller account of the flora
of this and the Amsmiz valley for the Appendix.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> departing from our camp
at Hasni, on May 18, our cavalcade was escorted by the friendly
sheik, Si Hassan, and two other native chiefs. Up to the last
moment, sick people had continued to arrive from distant villages,
and some of the late-comers were left unattended. As we started,
the population of the adjoining hamlet, who were gathered round the
camp, gave unequivocal tokens of good will and kindly wishes
towards the strange visitors, doubtless due to the good effects of
Hooker’s medical advice; and more friendly salutations reached us
at the villages as we passed. After descending the main valley for
a distance of three or four miles, we turned to the left, and began
to ascend in a westerly direction towards a depression in the hills
that enclosed us on that side. The opuntia and palmetto here grew
to a large size; and among many less familiar forms, the oleander
was a conspicuous ornament, growing freely up to about 4,500 feet
above the sea.</p>

<p>As we gradually wound upwards, and the Aït Mesan<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span> valley was finally lost to
view, we found that, instead of reaching a pass whence we should
descend into an adjoining valley more or less parallel to that
which we had left, the country before us was an undulating plateau,
extending over a space of many miles, through which no stream runs
from the higher mountains towards the plain. This plateau does not
subside gradually towards the low country as might have been
expected; for at almost every point we found higher ground lying
between us and the plain, in the form of rounded eminences, rising
some three or four hundred feet above the plateau. The soil was
calcareous, and the underlying pale limestone cropped up here and
there; but the stratification appeared very irregular. In some
places we noticed bosses of intrusive igneous rock of dark colour.
Though no villages were in sight, most of the surface was under
rude tillage; but the fields were gay with a multitude of wild
species in full flower.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the preceding days, the afternoon ride
seemed uneventful in a botanical sense, as we failed to find much
that was altogether new. The most interesting forms were several
fine <i>Orobanches</i>, which might here be studied with profit by
a traveller less pressed for time than we were. A great feast of
colour was presented to us as we approached Sektana, our camping
place, by a magnificent new <i>Linaria</i>, of which we had
hitherto seen only stunted and starved specimens. In some fields of
corn not yet in ear, the spikes of numerous dark crimson flowers
all but concealed the green, and gave to the surface a tone of
subdued splendour. The plant has been described by Hooker, in the
<em>Botanical Magazine</em> (vol. 98, No. 5983), as <i>Linaria
Maroccana</i>. The artist, who had not seen the wild plant, has
failed to attain the rich tint of the native flowers. In
cultivation, the colour loses its original depth, and in some
gardens it has faded to a pale purple or violet tint. From this,
and other differences shown in cultivation, it seems possible that
this may be an extreme form of <i>Linaria heterophylla</i> of
Desfontaines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span> a
plant so different in appearance that, at first sight, no one would
suspect very near relationship between them.</p>

<p>Our camp this evening was fixed on open ground, near the village
of Sektana. To the north, between us and the plain, a hill rose
some 400 or 500 feet, crowned by a castellated building, somewhat
similar to that at Tasseremout, of which all that we could learn
was that it had been built by Christians or Romans, the same word,
as before observed, bearing either interpretation. To the south,
the plateau stretched away in rolling downs, unbroken by tree or
house, save a few small plants—probably fruit trees—growing near
the village, about half-a-mile from our camp. We were received, on
our arrival, with some show of cordiality by three native sheiks;
and a <i>mona</i>, on a scale sufficient to satisfy even our greedy
soldiers, was forthcoming during the evening.</p>

<p>It appeared that Hooker’s fame as a physician had already spread
far and wide, to an extent that might, indeed, have been
inconvenient if we had remained longer in this district. On this
evening, and the following morning, troops of applicants for
medical relief continued to arrive at our camp, and amongst them a
<i>moullah</i> of reputed sanctity, from Moulaï Ibrahim, troubled
with some painful affection of the eyes.</p>

<p>Between the ordinary work at our plants, writing up journals,
and completing a letter from Hooker to the late Sir Roderick
Murchison, with a brief account of our proceedings up to this
point, the evening was fully occupied, and we enjoyed the change of
climate that had accompanied the return of fine weather. The
thermometer at 8 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> did not fall below
58°, and the mean of two closely accordant observations gave for
the height of our camp, 4,523 feet (1,378·7 m.) above the sea
level.</p>

<p>The morning of May 19 broke brilliantly. Although on the
preceding day we had travelled under a blue sky, the higher
mountains had been concealed by dense masses<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_242">[242]</span> of fleecy <i>cumuli</i>, and we were not
prepared for the grandeur of the panoramic view that was spread
before our eyes, as we sallied from our tents in the early morning.
A large portion of the range of the Great Atlas of Marocco stood
robed in glittering snow down to a height of about 7,000 feet above
the sea level, only the projecting ribs of rock appearing through
the white vestment along the higher and steeper ridges. In the
annexed sketch is shown the part of the range nearest to our camp,
lying between the head of the Aït Mesan valley, and that of the
next adjoining (much shorter) valley that opened nearly due south
from our station. The view, however, extended in both directions
far beyond the nearer part of the range. The high peaks of the
Ourika district were sharply cut against the sky, but so crowded
together that their relative position was not apparent. Farther
east were other high peaks, probably belonging to the district of
Glaoui. Turning westward, it was seen that to the right of the high
group shown in the sketch, the valley which feeds the main branch
of the Oued Nfys runs deep into the main range, which here sinks to
the comparatively low level of about 7,500 feet. Towards this
valley the high snow-clad mass before us fell with comparatively
easy slopes, nowhere difficult of access; and we indulged in the
hope that, by fixing our camp pretty high up, we should be able to
effect another ascent.</p>

<p>To the west of this great gap the main chain rises again to a
considerable height, but less by at least 2,000 feet than that of
the central range which we were now about to leave. The western
range also differs in being less continuous; the peaks are
comparatively isolated, and of massive, conical form; and the
intervening passes do not seem to rise above the level of tree
vegetation. We observed that, even allowing for its lesser
elevation, the western range showed much less snow, whether because
during the recent bad weather the precipitation was more
considerable on the eastern group, or because in the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> region nearer to the ocean
this had fallen mainly in the form of rain.</p>

<p>After a rather late breakfast, the hour fixed for the departure
of our travelling companion having arrived, we with much regret
bade adieu to Maw, whose engagements in England hastened his
return. He carried with him a considerable collection of living
plants which, owing to his skill and experience in managing this
difficult process, arrived in excellent condition, and have since
thriven in his garden in Shropshire. The soldiers of our escort who
accompanied him to Mogador, bore orders to the local authorities
which ensured their respect and attention, and, as we afterwards
learned, his journey was in every way successful.</p>

<p>Mid-day had passed before we started from Sektana, the morning
hours having been employed in collecting and laying in paper a
tolerably large mass of specimens. Our course lay over the plateau,
whose undulations gradually subsided towards the Oued Nfys. At a
distance of some seven miles from our camp we reached the brow of a
range of low broken cliffs of white limestone, facing westward
towards the broad valley of that stream. They are at a considerable
distance from the present bed, but were doubtless formed by erosion
at a distant period when the level was much higher than it now is.
Among other plants, a variety of the wild caper (described as
<i>Capparis ægyptia</i> by Lamarck) was here common, and was
afterwards often seen in similar stations as we travelled westward.
The flowers-buds are eaten raw by the natives, who call them
<i>Pan</i>.</p>

<p>Below us, on the fertile tract extending for three or four miles
from the foot of the cliffs towards the Oued Nfys, stood the
village of Gurgouri, overlooked by two <i>kasbahs</i> belonging to
the Governor of the district which we had now entered, also called
Gurgouri. The older fortress-like building, standing on a
projecting rock, was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_244">[244]</span> apparently uninhabited, and the Kaïd dwelt
in a less imposing structure close to the village.</p>

<p>Our present design was to approach the high summits of the Atlas
that we had viewed in the morning through one of the lateral
valleys of the Oued Nfys, whence, as it appeared, the ascent might
be effected without serious difficulty. The leaders of our escort
had ridden on before to announce our arrival, and, after a short
halt, we approached the village through a belt of gardens and olive
groves. No Governor appeared to meet us, but only a messenger with
some lame excuse for his non-appearance. It would seem that our
dissatisfaction at this want of attention was speedily reported,
and that the Kaïd’s second thoughts were different from his first,
for he presently appeared just at the entrance to his
<i>kasbah</i>. He was a tall, handsome man, courteous, but no way
cordial in his greeting. He invited us to stop at this place,
offering at the same time a suitable <i>mona</i>. It was necessary,
however, to bring the question as to our further progress to a
speedy decision; and when the proposal to ascend the neighbouring
mountains was met by a positive refusal, and an intimation that
such an expedition might be effected from Amsmiz, the adjoining
district to the W. of the Oued Nfys, Hooker at once decided to
continue our journey, and to refuse the proffered
entertainment.</p>

<p>It appeared that our refusal was felt by the Kaïd as a slight;
so, by way of offering an irresistible attraction, a cow was led
out and slaughtered on the spot, close to the <i>kasbah</i>. Fresh
beef is a delicacy rarely found in Marocco; but even this failed to
move us. Our greedy soldiers were furious at being baulked of the
opportunity for feasting and idling, which they evidently
considered the main object of their mission, and our departure from
Gurgouri was accompanied by the surly faces and muttered grumblings
of our escort.</p>

<p>It was only on the following day that, owing to the continuing
feud between the two men, we learned, through<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_245">[245]</span> our Mogador captain, that Kaïd el Hasbi
had here once more been scheming to frustrate the objects of our
journey. In announcing our arrival, he at once prejudiced the
Governor of Gurgouri against the intrusive Christians, who had come
to visit his district, and directly advised him not to let us enter
the mountain valleys. It is likely that this conduct was as much
prompted by a keen recollection of the discomfort of his recent
five days’ stay in the Aït Mesan valley, and the poorer fare there
available, as by mere fanatic dislike to Christians and strangers;
but we all know how readily fanaticism allies itself with the baser
passions of human nature, and neither were wanting in Kaïd el
Hasbi. In any case, it was only natural that a local Governor
should take his cue from the man who seemed to be the personal
representative of the authorities in Marocco.</p>

<p>If our soldiers were disappointed at missing a feast, we were in
no better humour at being foiled in what appeared a hopeful
project. We silently rode for nearly an hour amidst well-cultivated
fields and gardens before we finally reached the banks of the Oued
Nfys, at a village called Nurzam. The channel was some 300 yards in
width, cut out from the soft limestone strata that rose on either
side in steep banks about thirty feet high; while, in spite of the
recent rains, the stream was only about twenty yards in width, and
everywhere shallow. The day was so far advanced that we could not
linger here—a fact the more to be regretted as we found, on the dry
gravelly bed of the stream, several plants not before seen during
our journey. Among these were <i>Salvia ægyptiaca</i>, and a
curious <i>Antirrhinum</i>, nearly allied to, but different from,
the Algerian <i>A. ramosissimum</i>.</p>

<p>On the west side of the Oued Nfys, the ground rises gradually,
but not nearly to so high a level as the plateau of Sektana. The
underlying rock throughout the space between this and the next
valley descending from the Atlas appears to be covered with a thick
red earthy deposit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
sometimes of the consistence of clay, sometimes of a more friable
character, doubtless formed at the expense of the portion of the
Atlas at the head of the valley of the Oued Nfys.</p>

<p>No indications of glacial action were observed in this region,
or in the Amsmiz valley which we were about to visit. On the way to
Amsmiz we crossed a ravine fully 200 feet in depth, cut by a
streamlet through the clay beds, without reaching the underlying
rock. The country was in great part under tillage, and, although we
passed no villages, must maintain a considerable population. A few
interesting plants were seen; but time was pressing, and we could
not afford to halt. The sun set, casting a brilliant red glow over
the heaving plain that lingered for a short space longer on the
flanks of the mountains which here rise more abruptly than in the
district near Marocco. Our course was directed towards the narrow
opening of a valley, cleft through the outer range of the Atlas,
which we had already descried from a distance; and, after a gradual
descent, we arrived, about 8.15 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, some
time after dark, at Amsmiz.<a id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>This is the most considerable place on the northern declivity of
the Great Atlas, and, from the number of inhabitants, may deserve
to rank as a town. It stands on a shelf of flat rocky ground,
somewhat above the level of the adjoining plain, and nearly 200
feet above the stream issuing from the mountains close at hand,
which, for want of any other name, we have called the Amsmiz
torrent. The Governor of this district was, as we learned, a man of
some consequence, being a nephew of El Graoui, and brother-in-law
of the Governor of Mogador. We considered it a favourable omen
that, as we approached our camping ground close to the town, this
functionary, with a motley train of torchbearers, came out to meet
us, and, with much show of cordiality, welcomed us to his
district.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> He was
almost quite black, and of nearly pure Negro type, with the
sensual, but apparently good-humoured expression that is common
among that race. It was too late to discuss business on this
evening; and the less necessary to do so, as we knew that our large
and precious collections made in the Aït Mesan valley, and put up
in indifferent condition, would require a full day’s work, before
we could undertake a new excursion of any importance. An abundant
<i>mona</i> was provided; and general satisfaction appeared to
prevail in the camp at having reached this Capua of the Great
Atlas.</p>

<p>The 20th of May was a day of rest for the men and animals of our
party; but of rather hard work for the two botanists, who were for
eight or nine hours busily engaged in putting their collections
into order, and transferring the specimens from damp to dry paper.
The system of ventilating gratings which we adopted, works
admirably in a dry climate, and especially when it is possible to
expose the parcels to sunshine; and in such conditions most plants
may be dried without a single change of paper. The case is
different when, owing to rain, or the dampness of the climate, the
paper cannot be well dried, and the plants have to be laid in in a
more or less moist condition. Artificial heat may sometimes be
applied; but this is rarely available for travellers in such a
country as Marocco.</p>

<p>It was necessary to interrupt the work during the forenoon, in
order to pay a visit to the Governor. This was no matter of mere
ceremony, as it was essential to obtain his consent and assistance
towards carrying out the design—on which we had fixed our
hearts—of penetrating to the head of the Amsmiz valley, and
climbing some one of the higher adjoining peaks. We knew, indeed,
that in this part of the range, the Great Atlas does not attain so
high a level as it does farther east; but as the summits must reach
a height of fully 11,000 feet, they could not fail to exhibit the
characteristic vegetation of the higher zone, and at the same time,
unless we were again pursued by<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_248">[248]</span> bad weather, command a wide view over the
unknown country, on the south side of the chain.</p>

<p>The Governor was courteous and even friendly in manner, and in
general terms expressed his readiness to forward the objects of our
journey. He seemed pleased with the articles which Hooker presented
to him—a musical box, an opera-glass, and a long sheath-knife; but
when a thermometer was added, and an attempt made to explain the
use of the instrument, he at once returned it, saying that it would
be of no service, and that he would much prefer a brace of pistols.
The pistols were promised, and an unsuccessful attempt was actually
made to forward them a year later. All had gone smoothly so far;
but we were much disappointed when, the practical question of our
intended exploration of the Amsmiz valley being brought forward,
our friendly Governor expressed himself distinctly opposed to it,
the only ground assigned being some doubt as to our safety. As the
misbehaviour of Kaïd el Hasbi on the previous day had come to our
knowledge during the interval, we at once came to the conclusion
that the real obstacle was due to his machinations. On returning to
our camp, Hooker summoned El Hasbi, and administered a
‘blowing-up,’ which produced the most salutary results. He was told
that we were thoroughly aware of his treacherous conduct, and duly
warned that if any further difficulty were thrown in the way of our
reaching the high mountains, as we were fully authorised to do, a
report should be sent to the Viceroy and to El Graoui, with a
request that another officer should be sent to take charge of our
escort. This drew forth a multitude of excuses, and profuse
promises to do all that was possible to carry out our wishes. The
effect was soon apparent; for we learned in the course of the
afternoon that the Governor had summoned the sheik of the valley,
in order to arrange for our visit, while at the same time we
received an invitation to sleep that night in the <i>kasbah</i>,
which we thought it judicious to accept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>In the afternoon
we went out for a stroll, and were able to form a better idea than
we had hitherto done of the character of the scenery. The position
of Amsmiz somewhat reminds one of that of villages in Piedmont,
that stand at the opening of some of the interior valleys of the
Alps, and still more of similar places in the Apennines of Central
and Southern Italy. The lofty hills that form the outer extremity
of the spurs diverging from the Great Atlas slope rather steeply
towards the plain, while the torrent issues from them through a
cleft so narrow that no path is carried along it into the valley.
Trees, that naturally clothe the outer ranges of the Alps, are here
very scarce, and the upper declivity, as commonly in the Apennine,
is covered with brushwood and low shrubs; while the lower slopes
are partly under tillage, or else planted with olive and fig trees.
We descended from the plateau, where our camp stood close to the
town of Amsmiz at 3,382 feet (1,030·7 m.) above the sea, by steeply
sloping banks to the level of the torrent; and followed this for
some distance, collecting plants by the way; and then made a
circuit among fields, enclosed by high hedges, in which grew a
profusion of climbing plants. The chief prize of our excursion was
a curious new species of <i>Marrubium</i>, whose spherical heads of
flowers are beset with long stiff bristles hooked at the end,
formed by the elongated lower teeth of the calyx.</p>

<p>It was not without misgivings that we quitted our tents in the
evening to repair to the Governor’s <i>kasbah</i>. We had hitherto
been very successful in escaping the varied noxious insects that
prey on the human body, and which the walls of the first house we
had seen in Marocco and the concurrent testimony of all who know
the country declare to abound throughout the empire; but it now
seemed as if we must confront these enemies under circumstances
where we could not, without giving offence, resort to energetic
measures of precaution. We were, therefore, agreeably surprised,
when our host conducted<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_250">[250]</span> us to a room which, at least to the eye,
seemed scrupulously clean. Two beds were arranged, nearly in
European fashion, on low bedsteads; of other furniture there was
none, excepting a low carpet-covered divan. On the sill of a window
we found four or five Arabic books, the only ones which we saw in
the possession of a native in this country. Our report the next
morning agreed, that we had not been attacked by any enemy more
formidable than a few intrusive fleas.</p>

<p>Our slumbers during the night were made more agreeable by the
satisfactory information that all the requisite arrangements had
been made for our excursion in the Amsmiz valley, on the following
day. The sheik, as we were told, would provide a house for our
occupation in the highest village; and though nothing definite was
said as to the precise limits of our expedition, we relied on luck
and good guidance to turn our opportunities to account.</p>

<p>We rose early on the morning of the 21st, and employed some
spare time in looking about us. The <i>kasbah</i> was not nearly so
large as many that we had seen, but was distinguished by a certain
air of neatness, and there were sundry indications that its
possessor was superior in general intelligence and appreciation of
civilised life to those we had hitherto dealt with in Marocco. In
the court there was a small garden, wherein grew some large bushes
of a curious variety of the common myrtle, having the young
branches and leaves covered with a fine downy pubescence, the
leaves were of large size, and much crowded together, giving the
plant a peculiar aspect. We did not observe the myrtle in a wild
state anywhere in South Marocco; and these plants probably came
from some gardens in the city of Marocco.</p>

<p>The sheik of the valley made his appearance in due time, and we
at once perceived that he was reluctantly pressed into the service.
He presented an example, unusual among the Shelluhs, of genuine
religious fanaticism, never relaxing, during the three days which
we passed in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span> his
company, from an attitude of undisguised aversion to the
Christians, whom he was forced to treat with a faint show of
outward civility. We afterwards learned that it was by his express
order, that his people were prevented from applying for medical
advice, and kept aloof from us during our stay in the valley, not
even replying to the ordinary courteous salutation. The latter is
quite a remarkable incident, and without example in our pretty wide
experience of Oriental people.</p>

<p>Our party was as far as possible reduced in number, most of our
followers and all the escort, except two soldiers, being left
behind. After the usual delay, we were under way soon after 10
<span class="sc2">P.M.</span> Instead of directing our course
towards the cleft by which the torrent issues from the mountains,
we left the little town by the side farthest from the stream, and
rode across the strip of plain lying between it and the outer range
of steep hills. After riding about a mile we came to a place where,
according to the usage of the country, the weekly market was being
held. A considerable crowd of wild-looking people, most of them
apparently mountaineers, formed a busy throng, wherein, under
different dress and aspect, human nature showed itself much the
same as it does everywhere else. One half of the crowd was intent
on business, and hard bargains were driven where the difference
between the seller and the buyer may not have exceeded the tenth
part of a farthing. The rest were mere idlers, come to while away
the time in gossip, or in listening to professional story-tellers,
or in beholding the feats of serpent-charmers, who make a
precarious living by frequenting these gatherings.</p>

<p>We soon reached the hills, and began to mount by a well-beaten,
but rather steep path. The vegetation on the dry stony slopes,
mainly covered with brushwood, was already much parched, and we
noticed nothing of especial interest till we reached the top of the
ridge overlooking the valley of Amsmiz. Here stood two lonely
poplars,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> and an old
weather-beaten trunk measuring about five and a half feet in
circumference, seemingly of high antiquity. The tree appeared to be
in no way different from the <i>Juniperus Oxycedrus</i> of Southern
Europe, except that this rarely exceeds the dimensions of a bush
five or six feet high.</p>

<p>We now began to obtain a clearer view of the portion of the
Atlas chain which it was our present object to explore. The valley
before us was evidently different in character from those which we
had hitherto seen. Especially throughout its lower part, it is a
mere trench, whose sides slope with increasing steepness towards
the bed of the stream; while the flanks, throughout a zone of from
one to two thousand feet above the water, are but slightly
inclined, and afford space for numerous villages and for
cultivation. It is much shorter than the valleys in the Ourika and
Reraya districts; and, instead of being enclosed at its head by a
continuous ridge of great height, we here saw a single lofty
snow-streaked peak at the head of the valley, apparently separated
from the next eminences on either side by comparatively low passes,
over which an easy passage to the Sous valley must be found. The
peak which was the obvious aim of our expedition is known to the
Moors as Djebel Tezah, or Tezi, and its summit, which had already
attracted our notice from Sektana, can scarcely be more than
fifteen or sixteen miles, as the bird flies, from the point where
the torrent enters the plain near Amsmiz; whereas, in the part of
the chain first visited by us, the watershed must be everywhere
more than twenty miles from the northern foot of the mountains.</p>

<p>Our track descended slightly from the top of the ridge above
Amsmiz, and then continued nearly at a level for a considerable
distance, the torrent, which ran at a great depth below us on the
right, being usually concealed from view by the convexity of the
slope. We soon observed that several villages lying on the upper
slopes were mere piles of ruin. Some, as we learned, had been
destroyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span> by
hostile tribes, and others had been abandoned by their inhabitants
who had migrated elsewhere. Perhaps owing to the scantiness of the
present population, timber was more abundant here than usual in the
Great Atlas. Besides larger trees at intervals, the slopes along
which we rode were to a great extent covered with oak scrub to such
an extent as to leave little space for herbaceous plants. The
prevailing form of oak in this part of the valley tends to confirm
the opinion of those botanists who, with Visiani, consider the
common evergreen oak (<i>Quercus Ilex</i>), and the cork oak
(<i>Quercus suber</i>), to be forms of the same plant. In general
appearance, the oak here quite resembled <i>Q. suber</i>, and in
the older trees the tendency to form a corky outer bark was
apparent; but the anthers all showed traces of the sharp points
which are supposed to distinguish those of the common species.</p>

<p>At a point where a slender rivulet from the dry flanks of the
hills on our left enters the valley, we passed close to a small
village, with a belt of cultivation surrounding it, and soon after
began to descend steeply to the bed of the torrent, no longer so
distant from us as it had been in the lower part of the valley.
Here we found several fine plants not before seen, and then,
somewhat to our surprise, began to ascend, by a narrow and
difficult path, the steep rocky slope above the left bank of the
torrent. Our object was to pass the night at the uppermost end of
the valley, as near as possible to the foot of Djebel Tezah, and
the sheik had undertaken to conduct us to the highest village. We
were now informed that this stands on the west side, and some 600
or 700 feet above the level of the torrent. This was evidently
inconvenient, as our route on the following day must clearly keep
to the eastern bank; but there seemed to be no help for it, and, as
the rocks on this side were different in appearance, we perceived a
fair prospect of adding some novelties to our collections.</p>

<p>About 2 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> we reached Iminteli, the
poor village which served as our head-quarters for the next two
days.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> The weather
being now settled, our observations for altitude above the sea give
nearly the same results when compared with Mogador or with Amsmiz,
and that adopted was 4,418 feet (1,346·5 m.). The house of a Jew
had been cleared out for our reception. It was of rather more solid
construction than that in which we lodged at Arround, in the Aït
Mesan valley, but similar in plan. It appeared to be tolerably
clean, though on closer scrutiny a few bugs were detected, but in
far less numbers than we have seen in Sicily and some other places
in Europe. In pursuance of the sheik’s order, the Shelluh
inhabitants of this place kept carefully aloof from all
communication with us; but there were several Jew families who were
clearly well disposed towards the Christian strangers. When we
sallied forth, soon after our arrival, to examine the vegetation of
the rocky slopes above the village, one of these Jews volunteered
to accompany us. Conversation either in Hebrew or Shelluh being
unfortunately out of the question, our intercourse was necessarily
of the most limited character; but we could not fail to be struck
with the man’s air of intelligence and friendliness.</p>

<p>The character of the rocks throughout this valley is altogether
different from that of the more lofty range which we had previously
visited. The red sandstones, there so prevalent, are here absent,
and the strata are, without exception, schistose, though seemingly
varying much in mineral composition. In some places, and especially
on the ridge above Amsmiz, mica is present to an appreciable
extent; in others, and notably in the mass of Djebel Tezah, the
rock would pass under the old designation of clayslate; while in
this part of the valley calcareous schists prevail. Intrusive dykes
and bosses of porphyry and other igneous rocks were seen in many
places, but not to such an extent as to affect much the general
aspect of the surface. The stratification appeared to be very
irregular, but in general the beds are inclined at a high angle to
the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>We were led by
the difference in geological structure to anticipate a considerable
change in the flora, as compared with that with which we had
already made acquaintance; and this expectation was confirmed by
what we had seen during our morning’s ride, and still more by our
afternoon herborisation on the rocks and slopes above Iminteli.</p>

<p>We had already perceived that the vegetation of this part of the
Atlas is much less varied than that of Aït Mesan; and this
impression became stronger with subsequent experience. Something
may be due to the fact that we had there more time and opportunity
for close examination; but this could only slightly alter the
general result. This may be partly due to the more permeable
character of the rocks in the Amsmiz valley preventing moisture
from resting on the surface; and in part to the fact that, although
nearer to the Atlantic, the range here is less lofty, and the
precipitation of vapour, in the shape of rain or snow, is less
frequent and abundant during the summer months. The subject is more
fully discussed in <a href="#ape">Appendix E</a>; but it will be
seen by reference to our lists, that only seventy-six species seen
by us were confined to the Amsmiz valley, that nearly twice as many
were found common to both valleys, while more than three times that
number were seen in Aït Mesan, but not in Amsmiz. If a similar
comparison be made as to the endemic species which, as far as we
know, are peculiar to the flora of the Great Atlas, the proportions
are nearly identical. A further peculiarity of the vegetation here,
is the greater resemblance which it bears to that of the mountains
of Southern Spain than does that of the Aït Mesan valley. Several
plants not before seen by us were identical with Spanish species;
and of the undescribed forms here collected, at least four have
their nearest allies among the endemic plants of the Peninsula. Two
or three characteristic species of the Algerian flora were also
seen here for the first time; but these will doubtless be found to
extend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span> through the
intervening region when this has become accessible to scientific
travellers.</p>

<p>At two or three spots, during the afternoon, we had noticed
fragments of pine cones, which the more excited our curiosity, as
up to this we had not seen a true conifer in Marocco, and there was
no reason to expect the appearance in this region of any other
species than the Atlantic Cedar. When asked on the subject, the
sheik declared that they had been dropped by strangers who had come
from a great distance. The only explanation for a lie, apparently
so objectless, is to be found in the deep-rooted suspicion which
the mountain tribes feel as to all strangers, but which in the case
of the sheik was intensified by religious bigotry. It was
satisfactory to find a few trees about the highest point which we
reached—700 or 800 feet above the village—and to ascertain that the
cones belonged to the <i>Pinus halepensis</i>. It is remarkable
that, when questioned, our Jew guide gave for the tree the name
<i>Tæda</i>. There is much doubt as to the species which Pliny knew
by the name <i>Pinus Tæda</i>, but it is pretty clear that the
Romans applied the name <i>tæda</i> to various species of pine used
for torches; and to this day, in the Italian Tyrol, where brands of
<i>Pinus Mughus</i> are commonly adopted for that purpose, they go
by the name of <i>tea</i>. The preservation of the exact Latin term
in this remote region, along with that of the <i>furbiune</i>,
already mentioned, appears worthy of note.</p>

<p>Well content with our collections, we returned before sunset,
but our good-humour was soon troubled by the recalcitrant sheik,
who seemed resolved to frustrate the main object of our expedition.
When our interpreter was charged to arrange with him for our
departure early next morning, he returned an answer to the effect
that we could go with safety no farther than the village of
Iminteli; that the great mountain was frequented by the Sous
people, and could not safely be approached by us; and this was
wound up by a flat refusal to let us proceed any
farther.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> When it
was found that he stuck doggedly to this resolution, Hooker
judiciously resolved to assume a more resolute tone. ‘Tell him,’ he
said to Abraham, ‘that the Sultan has issued his order that we
should go to the snow—El Graoui has ordered that we shall go the
snow—the Kaïd of Amsmiz has ordered that we shall go to the snow—if
he refuses to carry out their orders, we shall return to Amsmiz,
and send a courier to the Viceroy and to El Graoui, and we shall
see what will be the consequence.’ After some delay, the answer
came, that if we went to the mountain, it would be necessary to
take an escort of fifty armed men. ‘Tell him,’ was the reply, ‘that
he may take as many men as he likes—five men, or fifty men, or none
at all—we do not care as to that; but the Sultan’s command must be
executed!’ The sheik sullenly gave way, and promised that all
should be ready for the next morning. After achieving this victory,
we proceeded to dust the floor profusely with insect powder, and to
spread our mattresses: our insect enemies either held aloof, or
performed their operations so deftly that we were unconscious of
their assaults, and slept till the first gleam of dawn showed in
the eastern sky.</p>

</div>

<p>When we sallied forth at 5 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>, on the
morning of May 22, the air was cool, but a light mist hung between
us and the mountains, the usual precursor of a hot day. When our
preparations for starting were complete, the sheik was not to be
seen; but presently a message came to say that he had gone on
ahead, and would await our arrival on the banks of the torrent
below the village. It seemed as if it involved an unnecessary
détour to return by the path which we had ascended the day before,
instead of aiming at a point higher up the valley; but a native who
was left to act as guide, insisted on keeping to the steep rocky
path with which we were already acquainted. At the appointed place,
by the bank of the torrent, we found the sheik, with four or five
ragged fellows, of whom but two were armed with long guns.
Anticipating any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
remark as to this sorry substitute for the promised escort of fifty
armed men, the sheik announced that more men would join the party
farther on. As we firmly disbelieved the stories of danger from the
terrible men of Sous, who are the bugbears of the population on the
northern side of the mountains, we never cared to call attention to
the fact that the promised reinforcements did not make their
appearance.</p>

<p>In the upper part of the valley, the trench which the torrent
has cut for itself is less deeply excavated than through its lower
course, and leaves space for a path, and a few straggling olive and
walnut trees; and in some spots for small patches of cultivation.
For about six miles we kept to the torrent bank, our horses
sometimes preferring its stony bed, till we reached the junction of
the two streams that feed the Amsmiz torrent. Between them rises
the peak of Djebel Tezah, and here the ascent of the mountain
begins. As the slope was still very gentle, we rode on a short
distance farther, after hurriedly collecting some interesting
plants, but soon came to a halt at a clump of fine walnut trees,
standing by our observations at 5,604 feet (1,708 m.) above the
sea. We had seen no village by the way, but only a few men engaged
in fashioning gunstocks from walnut wood. It appeared,
nevertheless, that there was a small village near at hand, and this
place would be the proper starting point for travellers intending
to make the ascent. There would be no difficulty in conveying small
tents hither from Amsmiz.</p>

<p>Much to our satisfaction, the sheik now withdrew, committing us
to the charge of an active, but unarmed young Shelluh, with strict
injunctions to lead as far as the snow, but not to allow us to
proceed farther. It is hard to say whether the sheik and his people
felt any real uneasiness as to the possibility of a casual
encounter with natives of the Sous valley; but it was pretty clear
that they had succeeded in frightening our attendants, as our
Mogador men, usually so active and attentive, soon<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span> dropped behind, and were not
again seen till our return in the afternoon. We took the most
direct course in the ascent, following a slight gully down which
flowed a mere trickling rivulet, fed by the snows on the upper
slope of the mountain, and pushed on rather fast with a view to get
as high on the mountain as possible before the sun reached the
meridian.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the great diversity in the vegetable population
which is seen in Southern Spain (the high mountain region nearest
to the Great Atlas), where neighbouring peaks of different mineral
structure exhibit numerous quite distinct species, and very few
identical features, and having found the flora of the lower valley
to a great extent different from that of Aït Mesan, we confidently
reckoned on obtaining still greater evidence of distinctness in
that of the upper region. It was therefore with some surprise that,
as we continued the ascent, we met, one after another, many of the
peculiar species that we had first seen in the ascent from Arround
to the Tagherot Pass, and comparatively few not already familiar to
us. For once, however, it must be owned that during part of this
day, our emotions as botanists yielded to the interest that we felt
in the near prospect of a peep into <i>terra incognita</i>.</p>

<p>If but little had been hitherto known of the northern slopes of
the Great Atlas from the reports of the few travellers who had
viewed the range from the low country, or attained its outer
slopes, the southern side of the main chain remained a sealed book
to geographers, whose reliance on the vague reports of native
informants has led them, like the chartographers of the middle
ages, to fill up the blank space on their maps by representations
utterly discordant and contradictory. Ever since we had been in
South Marocco, we had heard of the Sous valley, as the proper home
of everything strange and marvellous to be found in the empire. It
is there, our informants assured us, that lions and other savage
beasts roam at leisure,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_260">[260]</span> there pythons twenty or even thirty feet
long lie in wait for the traveller, mines of the precious metals
abound in Sous, and in Sous the soil is so fertile that all the
products of nature are obtained without labour. But of the physical
features of the country we could learn nothing. Whether it were
enclosed on the southern side by a second lofty range, or
Anti-Atlas, parallel to that we already knew, or merely by
secondary branches diverging from the main chain, and from how far
eastward the sources of the Sous might flow, were all matters quite
unknown to us. One European, indeed, had traversed some part of the
valley, and should have been able to throw some little light on
these obscure points; but unfortunately the few lines in which
Gerhard Rohlfs recounts his adventurous journey to Tarudant, and
thence eastward to the northern skirts of the Sahara, give scarcely
any information. He speaks of high mountains lying south of the
Sous valley, but says nothing to show what relation these bear to
the main chain. It appears from his account, that no considerable
ascent is necessary in order to pass from the southern branch of
the Sous to the streams that flow southward towards the Great
Desert; but whether the Great Atlas and the Anti-Atlas are
throughout their length separated by a broad trough, in the same
way as Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, or Anti-Atlas be a diverging range
over which Rohlfs made his way by a deep pass or depression, it is
impossible to infer from his narrative.</p>

<p>By the time we reached the lower skirts of a long snow slope
that stretched upwards towards the summit of the mountain, the sun,
which had now ascended nearly to the zenith, beat down upon us with
intense rays, that drove two of the party to seek some temporary
shelter. The Shelluh guide probably considered that he had done his
day’s work; and, finding a narrow rim of shadow under an
overhanging rock, lay down, with his head screened from the blazing
heat. Ball, who was suffering from a violent head-ache, also found
a spot that gave partial<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_261">[261]</span> shade. Hooker took advantage of the halt to
push on at a steady pace that soon carried him beyond the reach of
interference from the guide. When Ball felt able to resume the
ascent, the guide sprung to his feet, and for the first time became
aware that one of the party was already too far ahead to be easily
overtaken. He proceeded by a series of unearthly yells and frantic
gesticulations, to attempt to attract Hooker’s attention, and urge
his return. When these demonstrations were found to be useless, and
he perceived that Ball was also about to follow in the ascent, he
commenced a fresh series of exclamations and pantomimic gestures,
of which the burden seemed to be that if we went to the top, we
were certain to be shot; but the same argument that was used with
effect on the Tagherot Pass—the gift of a silver coin—was so far
successful that no attempt was made to arrest Ball’s progress, and,
after ascending a few hundred feet higher, the unwilling guide gave
up the attempt, and rested comfortably until he had an opportunity
of rejoining Hooker in his descent.</p>

<p>It was perhaps fortunate for our object of reaching the summit
of the mountain as early as possible, that the slope by which we
ascended is extremely dry and barren. A few species, already seen
on the Tagherot Pass, were gathered near the snow, but the upper
ridges showed only a few perennial species in flower, of which the
most conspicuous was a variety of <i>Alyssum montanum</i>. Most of
the others were stunted bushes, one of them being a dwarf form of
the common gooseberry, with stems about a foot long, lying flat on
the surface of the rocky soil. Throughout the ascent the rock was
of schistose structure, seemingly argillaceous, but in some places
containing a notable proportion of lime, and here and there showing
traces of mica. Intrusive dykes and bosses of reddish porphyry
appear in places, but do not play a conspicuous part in the aspect
of the mountain.</p>

<p>Hooker reached the summit about 2 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>,
and was rejoined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> by
Ball nearly half an hour later. Excepting some light fleecy cumuli
floating over the low country to the north, at a lower level than
the eye, the sky was cloudless; but in some directions a thin haze
obscured the details of the vast panorama. Our first glance was
inevitably directed towards the unknown region to the south, and
there, at a distance of fifty or sixty miles, rose the range of
Anti-Atlas, showing a wavy outline, with rounded summits, and no
apparent deep depression, rising, as we estimated, to a height of
from 9,000 to 10,000 feet above the sea. The highest portion within
our range of view, and the only part with a somewhat rugged
outline, bore a few degrees west of due south, and corresponded in
position with the Djebel Aoulouse of the French map. A somewhat
darker shade traceable at some places on the flanks of this dimly
seen range, possibly indicated the existence of forests, or at
least of shrubs covering the slopes.</p>

<p>When the first impulse of curiosity was partially satisfied, we
began to take more careful note of our position, and to study in
detail a view which had been so long denied to us. The first fact
that struck us, was that the peak on which we stood lies a
considerable way north of the watershed. The axis of the main
chain, which here subsides into undulating masses from 2,000 to
3,000 feet lower than Djebel Tezah, lay between us and the central
portion of the Sous valley, and, even if the prevailing haze over
the lower districts had not veiled the details, would probably have
cut off the course of the stream and the rich tracts that are said
to fringe its banks. The higher strata of the atmosphere, above the
level of about 7,000 feet, were, however, delightfully clear
towards the east and west, and every feature of whatever portion of
the main chain lay within our range was easily traced even at
distances of thirty or forty miles. An extraordinary change had
occurred during the three days since we had viewed the chain from
Sektana, covered in deep snow<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_263">[263]</span> down to the level of about 7,000 feet, and
showing only a few crests of precipitous rock here and there
protruding. The white mantle had now completely disappeared, and
only long streaks of snow filling the depressions of the surface
now seamed the flanks of the higher mountains, leaving the summit
ridges everywhere bare. During the ascent of the northern face of
the mountain, we had kept close to one of these long and
comparatively narrow snowslopes that extended through a vertical
zone of over 2,000 feet, with a breadth of some 300 to 400 feet,
and we now saw a still longer and wider strip of the same
character, filling a shallow trough below us, on the east face of
the peak. Near to the summit, and on the ridges leading to it, not
a trace of snow was to be seen, even in the crevices of the rocks,
where it would find partial shelter from the sun.</p>

<p>We now proceeded to survey the field of view, in order, if
possible, to fix the positions of any conspicuous summits. Looking
due west, nothing approaching our level lay between us and the dim
horizon. A succession of projecting spurs of the Atlas, dividing as
many successive valleys, subsided into the plain; the most
prominent, and that extending farthest from the main chain, being
the mountain above Seksaoua. Turning the eye a little to the left,
about west by south, we saw crowded together many of the higher
summits of the western portion of the main range, which was here
seen foreshortened, so that it was impossible to judge of their
true relative position. The highest of these, seamed with snow, we
judged to be about twenty-five miles distant, and higher than
Djebel Tezah by 600 or 800 feet. In nearly the same direction, but
only about ten miles distant, was a rugged projecting peak, rising
some 300 feet above our level, and very many more of somewhat lower
elevation were discernible in the space between us and the more
distant points. Between SW. and SSE., the range of Anti-Atlas,
rising behind the broad Sous valley, bounded the horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>At our feet, and
cutting off from view the course of the river Sous, the mountain
mass that here forms the axis of the main chain presented the
appearance of a troubled sea of a light ferruginous colour,
declining gradually in elevation from W. to E. At a distance of
about eight miles ESE. of Djebel Tezah it sinks to an estimated
height of little over 7,000 feet, at the head of the main branch of
the Oued Nfys, and offers the only apparently easy pass over the
main chain which we had yet seen.<a id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The rocky sunburnt flanks
of the mountains were dotted with trees of dark foliage, doubtless
some form of the evergreen oak, up to a height of about 8,000 feet
above the sea, for the most part solitary, sometimes in clumps, but
nowhere forming a continuous forest. The numerous feeders of the
Oued Nfys had cut deep ravines in the flanks of the mountains, and
were lost to sight, except where gleams of silver light shot
upwards from the deeper valleys amid the walnut trees that fringed
their banks. Numerous hamlets were seen, some perched upon
projecting ridges, some lying in hollows and girdled with a belt of
emerald-green crops.</p>

<p>It was impossible not to speculate on the condition of these
primitive mountaineers, who have since the dawn of history
preserved their independence. Leo Africanus, speaking of the very
district now overlooked by us, which he calls Guzula, says that the
people were in his day molested by the predatory Arabs and by ‘the
lord of Marocco;’ but they successfully resisted all encroachments,
and no attempt is now made to assert the Sultan’s authority among
them, or to enforce tribute. Something they have doubtless gained
in material, and still more in moral, welfare by stubborn
resistance to alien rule; but the prosperity that is sometimes
attained by tribes subject to the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_265">[265]</span> semi-feudal rule of chiefs, and among whom
intestine feuds are rooted in immemorial tradition, is usually
short-lived.</p>

<p>Our hope of getting further knowledge as to the eastern
extremity of the Sous valley, and the orographic relations between
the Atlas and Anti-Atlas ranges was not to be satisfied. Djebel
Tezah, as we found, stands some way north of the axis of the chain,
while the great mass that rose over against us between ENE. and
ESE., extending to the head of the Aït Mesan valley, sends out
massive buttresses to the south, and by these our view of
Anti-Atlas was cut off to the SE. On one of these western
projecting buttresses, we could distinguish a large village
belonging to the district of Tifinout, and standing at an elevation
of nearly 7,000 feet. Turning our eyes to the north of true east,
many of the higher summits of the</p>

<div class="figcenter iw4">
<figure class="iw4" id="i13"><img src='images/i13.jpg' alt=''>
</figure>
</div>

<p class="nind">chain were seen rising above the intervening
ranges, the most distant probably belonging to the Glaoui group,
east of Tasseremout. Once more we came to the conclusion, that
throughout the portion of the Great Atlas chain visible from the
city of Marocco, between the easternmost feeders of the Oued
Tensift and those of the Oued Nfys, there are no prominent peaks
notably surpassing the average level. Many of them must surpass the
limit of 13,000 feet above the sea, but it is not likely that any
one attains the level of 13,500 feet. The last object that
attracted our attention in the panorama, in a direction about east
by north, was an isolated mass, forming a bold promontory on the
northern side of the chain, of which a rough outline is here
given.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>When the
engrossing interest of the distant view had so far subsided as to
let us pay attention to nearer objects, we were struck by the
unexpected appearance of considerable remains of dwellings on a
platform of level ground, only a few feet below the actual summit
of the mountain. About a dozen rude stone dwellings, all in a
ruinous condition, with chambers sunk a couple of feet below the
level of the ground, and the roofs fallen in, had at some former
period been here erected; but we saw no traces of recent
occupation. It seemed most probable that they were intended as
shelter for herdsmen, who had driven their flocks in summer to this
lofty station.</p>

<p>As we lingered on the topmost point of the mountain, the intense
silence of the scene was broken by the distant scream of a large
grey eagle that soared over our heads, and then sailed away
southward over the Sous valley, making the deep stillness still
more sensible than before.</p>

<p>The interval allowed for musing was not long; there was still
much to be done, and we started to our feet to make ready for the
descent. The observations for altitude had still to be recorded,
and the usual difficulty of ascertaining the temperature of the air
was here experienced. With a hot sun falling on an exposed rocky
ridge, it is impossible to isolate the instrument from the effects
of radiation. The result is usually to register too high a
temperature; but the effect of placing the thermometer in a cleft
where the rock is much below the temperature of the air leads to
error in the opposite direction. The temperature here adopted was
60° Fahr., and the result of a comparison with Mogador gives a
height a few feet above 11,000 feet, while the comparison with
Iminteli falls a little below that level, the mean adopted being
exactly 10,992 feet (3,350·1 m.)</p>

<p>After bottling a few beetles that were brought to light by
turning over some flat stones, we gave a last glance at the ridge
of Anti-Atlas, and at a quarter-past three<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_267">[267]</span> turned to the descent. It was clearly
desirable to take a different line from the straight course
followed in the ascent, and we speedily agreed on the plan of
action most likely to add to the botanical results of the ascent,
which hitherto had fallen somewhat short of our expectations. The
round-backed ridge sloping westward from the summit throws out a
massive spur, projecting nearly at right angles or somewhat E. of
N., so as to enclose a recess in the mountain into which a large
part of the drainage of the northern slope is collected; there was
reason, therefore, to count on finding there a more varied
vegetation than on the bare slopes enclosing it. On the projecting
spur above it, we were struck by the appearance of trees, evidently
not coniferous, scattered at intervals along the slopes, while the
greener tint of the surface gave some promise to the botanist. It
was, therefore, desirable that this ridge should not escape
examination. A rapid descent soon brought us to a point overlooking
the hollow recess of the mountain where we were rejoined by our
Shelluh guide, who had now assumed a crest-fallen air, and we at
once determined to separate, Hooker with the guide descending into
the hollow, Ball making a circuit by the ridge to the left. The
time at our disposal being so short, it was impossible to examine
the ground carefully, and many species were doubtless overlooked,
but we were both rewarded by finding several plants not seen
elsewhere during our journey. Among others Hooker secured a dwarf,
very spiny barberry, with blueish-black berries, seemingly not
different from the Spanish variety of <i>Berberis cretica</i>; and
lower down, near the base of the mountain, a fine white-flowered
columbine, fully four feet high, probably a variety of the common
<i>Aquilegia vulgaris</i>, widely spread throughout the mountain
regions of Europe and Asia, but not, as we believe, before found in
the African continent. Ball, who reached the rendezvous half an
hour after Hooker, brought down with him a curious little succulent
plant, forming a new species of the genus
<i>Monanthes</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
hitherto known only in the islands of the Canary and Cape de Verde
groups, along with three species of the lily tribe, all of them
found in Southern Europe, but not before seen in Marocco. The tree
was found to be the belloot oak (<i>Quercus Ballota</i> of
Desfontaines), a variety of the evergreen oak, which is spread
through North Africa and Spain, where the sweet acorns are commonly
roasted and eaten, as chestnuts are elsewhere. Many of the trees
are of great age and have thick trunks, and weather-beaten stunted
branches, and are apparently the remains of extensive forests that
once clothed the flanks of this part of the Atlas up to a height of
about 8,500 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>Hooker found the sheik in a state of thorough exasperation at
our success in defeating his orders, probably aggravated by the
tedium of waiting for our return. He discharged volleys of fierce
abuse at the guide who had failed to keep us within the prescribed
limits, but was not openly disrespectful in his manner towards the
Christian <i>hakim</i> who had come to his country under the
immediate shadow of imperial protection. Foreseeing future trouble
in returning through the valley after dark, he was evidently much
annoyed at the necessity for awaiting Ball’s arrival. To calm his
impatience, Hooker lent him a field telescope, and the novel
experience so much amused him that his ill-humour appeared to
vanish for the time. Uncivilised men are like children, rarely
remaining long under the same impression; and even when seemingly
quite possessed by some strong feeling, are led away from it by the
veriest trifle.</p>

<p>As required by the inevitable rule of hospitality, a <i>mona</i>
was offered by the people of the adjoining hamlet in the shape of a
dish of <i>keskossou</i>, barely tasted by us, but speedily
despatched by our followers, and at 6.15 <span class=
"sc2">P.M.</span> we started on horseback to return to our
night-quarters at Iminteli. The sun set before 7, and a brief
interval of twilight soon gave place to a dark, though
star-lit,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span> night. In
the open there was no difficulty in following the track along the
torrent; but at one place, in riding through a walnut grove, we
were reminded of our night-adventure in the Aït Mesan valley. The
thicker branches of the walnut do not, however, lie low, as do
those of the olive, nor are they beset with the stiff jagged
leafless branchlets that made the latter so dangerous in the
dark.</p>

<p>The grove was traversed without trouble; but another
unlooked-for experience was in store for us. We had complained in
the morning of what seemed a roundabout way taken in descending
from Iminteli to the bottom of the valley; and perhaps the sheik
now took a malicious pleasure in showing us the advantages of a
short cut. Leading the way, he rode across the torrent, which
barely reached the horse’s knees, and began to ascend the slope
above the left bank. Before long he struck into the bed of a
brawling streamlet that came tumbling over loose boulders down the
declivity. As we advanced, the way became steeper, and shut in on
either side by tall bushes and straggling climbers, all, as it
seemed, beset with hooks and spines. There was nothing for it but
to rely on our riding animals to carry us through as best they
could, and wonderfully they demeaned themselves. Though patches of
sky showed overhead, to our eyes the ground below was absolutely
invisible; the boulders were evidently very large and slippery, and
it was only by the most desperate struggles that the poor beasts
succeeded in clambering up the slope, pausing frequently, with
muscles quivering all over from the violence of their renewed
struggles. The only thing for the riders to do was to hold on at
all hazards, and keep their heads bent low, so as to save their
faces from the spiny branches, that made havoc of their nether
garments.</p>

<p>The time seemed very long before we finally emerged on the shelf
of more level ground which lies along this<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_270">[270]</span> side of the valley, and soon after reached
our quarters at Iminteli, at about half-past eight. As we knew that
we should have time on the following morning, and the day’s work
had been rather fatiguing, we yielded to the claims of nature, let
our collections rest in their boxes and portfolios for the night,
and soon after supper lay down to sleep.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> morning hours of May 23
were devoted to the necessary work at our collections of the
preceding day; but before our departure we once more took a short
ramble through the ground surrounding the village. With a single
exception, all the plants seen were species common to the Spanish
peninsula, two or three being characteristic of Central Spain.
Apart from the style of building and the dress of the inhabitants,
a stranger transported to the spot might easily suppose himself
somewhere in Southern Europe, though closer examination would
suggest differences to the naturalist. At noon we started on the
way to Amsmiz, halting at the torrent in the bottom of the valley
to secure specimens of two very fine and undescribed plants, both
very troublesome to the collectors. One was a spiny <i>Genista</i>,
with very numerous, stiff, intricate branches; the other a fine
thistle, five or six feet high, whose long woolly leaves were beset
with sharp, slender, golden spines, fully an inch in length.</p>

<p>Without much further delay, we retraced the track that we had
followed on the morning of the 21st. We were once more struck by
the remarkable coolness of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_272">[272]</span> the climate of this region as compared with
somewhat similar positions in higher latitudes on the north and
east sides of the Mediterranean. Although the sun at noon now
approached within less than 15 degrees of the zenith, the
temperature in the shade was pleasantly cool, scarcely rising above
70° F. At the same season, and at a greater height, on the Lebanon
we have seen the thermometer stand above 80° in the shade by day,
and scarcely fall to 70° at night. This is mainly due to the cool
winds that prevail along the coast, and extend some way inland,
though not much felt in summer in the city of Marocco. As we rode
along the eastern flank of the valley, and down the slopes above
Amsmiz, we were pleasantly fanned by a NW. breeze that often lasts
throughout the day, but subsides at night.</p>

<p>On the brow of the declivity overlooking Amsmiz, we met a
messenger from Arround, our stopping-place at the head of the Aït
Mesan valley, come to implore our protection for the unfortunate
inhabitants, whose appeal to us had only brought them into fresh
trouble. The story had of course been reported to the Vice-Governor
(El Graoui’s deputy) with the circumstance of the sacrifice of the
sheep. He had resented this attempt to escape from his authority,
had had some of the suppliants severely beaten, and sent two more
men of the village to prison. It seemed very doubtful whether any
interference on our part might not merely aggravate the condition
of these unfortunate people. We promised, however, to do what we
could for them; and before we left Mogador it was reported, whether
truly or falsely, that we had been successful in our
intercession.</p>

<p>On returning to our camp at Amsmiz we found work in abundance
ready to hand. Our precious collections from the Aït Mesan valley,
including, as they did, the most interesting results of our
expedition, had been lying for three days untouched; and it was
necessary to go through them all again, putting into separate
parcels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> those that
were dry and those still requiring pressure between dry paper. With
the exception of half an hour given to another interview with the
friendly Kaïd of Amsmiz, we were thus occupied until long after
midnight. Although our store of drying-paper was large, the demand
often exceeded the supply, and many a friendly contest arose as to
respective rights of property in parcels of soiled paper, here
priceless, which elsewhere would have seemed of no value. Those who
have had experience in this line know that the labour of a
botanical collector is not light, and in truth it would be almost
intolerable if it were not for its compensating pleasures. It often
happened that the solitary candle was in use throughout the entire
night, Ball working till two o’clock or later, when Hooker would
rise, more or less refreshed, and keep up work till daylight.</p>

<p>But in the pursuits of a naturalist there are abundant sources
of satisfaction not suspected by the uninitiated. These are not
merely derived from the objects themselves, suggesting as they
often do interesting trains of thought and speculation; there are
further springs of keen enjoyment in the countless impressions with
which they are linked by the subtle influence of association. Much
of the pleasure that an artist, however unskilled, derives from
travel, arises from the power of each sketch to bring back again to
the mind the original scene of which it is but the imperfect
transcript. If he be active and industrious, he may preserve a
dozen such keys to the impressions of each day’s journey. But to
the botanist almost every specimen is indissolubly linked in the
memory with the spot where it was collected; and as he goes through
the produce of his day’s work, every minute detail is vividly
presented to the mind, along with the wider background that lay
behind the original picture. The wonder and awe that dwell around
the mountain fastnesses, the consolation of the forest glade, the
indefinable grandeur of the desert plain, nay, even the
bleak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span> solitariness
of northern moorland and morass—these dominant impressions
suggested by the aspects of nature are varied and enriched for the
naturalist by the myriad phases of beauty that are disclosed to the
eye of the observer. The glory of colour in the gentian and
saxifrage and golden <i>Alyssum</i>, and the other bright creatures
that haunt the mountain tops; the tender grace of the delicate
ferns that dwell in the rocky clefts; the teeming life of the warm
woodland; the strange beauty of the unaccustomed forms that spring
up in the desert solitudes; the purple glow of the heath relieving
the sombreness of the leaden sky, and the delicate structures of
the <i>Drosera</i> and <i>Menyanthes</i>, and bog-asphodel, and
many another inhabitant of our northern bogs—these and countless
other images are instantaneously revived by contact with the
specimen that grew beside them. Strangest of all is, perhaps, the
enduring nature of this connection. Often does it happen, as many a
botanist can testify, that after a lapse of a quarter, nay, even
half, a century, the sight of a specimen will bring back the
picture, seemingly effaced long ago, of its original home.</p>

<p>We were on foot again at 5.30 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>, May
24, and the order for departure went forth. But, as usual, there
were unexpected causes for delay. Many sick came to invoke Hooker’s
medical skill, some trifling presents were to be distributed, and
finally word was brought that the Kaïd meant to accompany us for
some distance on our day’s journey, and it was necessary to await
his appearance. Among the articles provided for presents we had
included scissors and needles; but such things, especially the
needles, were everywhere disregarded by the natives, whether Moor
or Shelluh; and it appeared that the art of sewing, as well as
every other occupation requiring the slightest manual dexterity,
is—at least in country places—exclusively practised by the Jews; to
them, accordingly, such gifts were very welcome. In the larger
towns there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> are, of
course, many handicrafts, and notably the making of slippers and
boots, practised by the Moors; but such trades are for the most
part hereditary in certain families, and the ordinary Moor affects
to despise all occupations of the kind.</p>

<p>At half-past eight the Kaïd appeared, mounted on a strong
serviceable horse; and, everything being ready, we rode down the
steep bank above which stands the town of Amsmiz, and, after
following the torrent for a short distance, reascended to about the
same level above the left bank. We now found ourselves on the verge
of a wide open plain, sloping gently from south to north, and our
course to Mzouda—the next stage in our journey—lay a little north
of due west, while the outer range of the mountains trended away to
S.W. We had been led to suppose that Mzouda lay, like Amsmiz, at
the foot of the Great Atlas, and might therefore serve as
starting-point for another excursion into its recesses; but it was
now clear that it must stand far out in the plain, many miles from
the nearest range of hills. We were somewhat comforted, however, by
the positive assurance that Seksaoua, the next stopping-place
beyond Mzouda, stands close to the mountains at the opening of a
considerable valley, and was therefore a promising spot for our
purposes.</p>

<p>The difficulty of getting correct information in such a country
as this, as daily experience proved to us, is one of the most
serious difficulties of the traveller, and depends quite as much on
the incapacity of the natives as on the habitual suspicion with
which all strangers are regarded. One day when Kaïd el Hasbi
appeared to be in unusual good-humour we were endeavouring to
obtain from him information as to some place on our route, and the
interpreter being told to ask if he could make the matter clearer
by reference to the cardinal points, he answered in a tone of
contempt, ‘Does he take me for the captain of a steamer?’</p>

<p>After riding with us for two or three miles the Kaïd of Amsmiz
bade us a friendly farewell; and we continued in<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> our course across the plain,
with occasional halts, in order more closely to examine the
vegetation, which was here less varied and interesting than usual.
Most of the surface was under grain crops—chiefly wheat and
barley—now ripe, and in great part cut and carried away. In the
drier waste tracts we once more came upon the characteristic
vegetation of the plains, <i>Acacia</i>, <i>Zizyphus Lotus</i>,
<i>Rhus pentaphylla</i>, and <i>Withania frutescens</i> being the
prevailing shrubs. Of herbaceous plants <i>Elæoselinum meoides</i>,
and other large <i>Umbelliferæ</i>, with <i>Compositæ</i> of the
thistle tribe, were most conspicuous.</p>

<p>In Beaudouin’s map the chief branch of the Oued Nfys is shown as
flowing parallel to the Atlas range from the south-west of Amsmiz,
and receiving as tributaries the Amsmiz torrent and the broad
stream that we had crossed near Gurgouri. On this day we satisfied
ourselves that this representation is erroneous. The unanimous
statements of the natives, confirmed by our own observations,
proved that all the waters flowing northward from the mountains
between Amsmiz and the borders of Mtouga are united in the stream
that we had traversed at Sheshaoua on its way to the main river
Tensift. The practice of intercepting the streams from the Atlas,
and carrying them across the plain through irrigation channels
below the surface, makes it extremely difficult to unravel the
hydrography of this region.</p>

<p>About noon we reached the boundary that separates the districts
of Amsmiz and Mzouda, and agreed to the suggestion of a mid-day
halt under trees near a large village, of which, as we learned,
many of the inhabitants are Jews. From early morning the clouds had
been gathering along the mountain range, and by this time had quite
covered the sky. The temperature was unusually low, not rising
above 62° F. in the shade, and our hard work during most of the
preceding night supplies the only excuse for the fact that, after a
light luncheon, we both fell fast asleep, until aroused by the
information that it was two o’clock,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_277">[277]</span> and high time to continue our journey. The
flora being somewhat monotonous, we did not, perhaps, lose much by
this unusual neglect of duty; but we remembered with regret that we
had not ascertained to what species the tamarisk tree belonged
under which we had taken our rest.</p>

<p>The boundary between Amsmiz and Mzouda is here formed by a
torrent bed, now nearly dry, called by our escort Asif el Mel. This
stream, as was agreed on all hands, joins those farther west that
run by Sheshaoua to the Oued Tensift. As we rode onward across the
plain several heavy showers passed over, which thoroughly drenched
the scantily clothed men of our party, without at all quenching
their habitual good-humour, but the soldiers were well provided
with woollen coverings that kept them tolerably dry. There was
little attempt at collecting-plants during the afternoon, as it
requires a strong inducement to make a horseman whose outer
clothing is thoroughly wet set foot to the ground. We found the
village of Mzouda rather different in appearance from those we had
hitherto seen. The houses—small cubical blocks built of clay dried
in the sun—were less solid than the rough stone dwellings of the
Atlas mountaineers, but much superior to the miserable huts of the
Arab tribes in the plain of Marocco; and instead of the unsightly
piles of thorny branches commonly used by the latter, these were
enclosed within massive hedges of <i>Opuntia</i> whose dimensions
showed that they were of considerable age.</p>

<p>As usual Kaïd el Hasbi had ridden forward with one of the
soldiers to present the letter to the Governor, and to announce our
arrival; and when, about 6 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, we
reached the <i>kasbah</i>, quite a mile from the village, we
received a message inviting us to take up our quarters within the
building. As the ground outside was already wet, and the evening
sky threatened more rain, we at once accepted the offer, and were
conducted to two small but clean-looking rooms in a square tower
that formed one of the angles of the building. Between the care of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span> small
collections made during the day, and writing up our notes, and a
frugal supper, the time was fully occupied until 10 <span class=
"sc2">P.M.</span>, when by previous arrangement we paid our visit
to the Governor.</p>

<p>We found a spare-looking man of serious mien, quite devoid of
the coarse, overfed, sensual aspect common among the men in
authority in Marocco. The usual conversation as to the objects of
our journey, led to an assurance that the district under his
jurisdiction did not extend to the higher peaks of the Atlas, or,
as it was expressed, ‘did not go to the snow.’ This may not
improbably have been quite true, but our experience of El Hasbi’s
machinations made us now very incredulous as to such statements. It
was, however, obvious that Mzouda was not a convenient centre for
mountain excursions, and we made no objection to the proposal that
we should on the following day proceed to Seksaoua, which stands
close to the foot of the mountains.</p>

<p>When we came to know more of his history, we found no cause to
wonder at the grave and depressed demeanour of our host. He had
succeeded to the government of his native district in early life,
and had held it for many years when he was invited by the Sultan to
Fez. On his arrival he was thrown into a dungeon where he had
remained ten years, frequently subjected to torture, until so much
of the wealth he was supposed to have amassed during his
administration had been disgorged as satisfied the demands of the
sovereign or some ruling favourite; and then, being released, he
was sent back again to govern his district with the agreeable
prospect of renewing the same experience after some uncertain
interval. If actual fact in this country did not supply frequent
proof, it would seem scarcely credible that the attractions of
power and comparative wealth should induce men to face such a
terrible, yet almost inevitable, future.</p>

<p>The sky had cleared during the night, but the morning of May 25
was unpromising. At 8 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>, shortly before
we started, the thermometer marked only 65° F.,
although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span> our
observations showed that in our yesterday’s ride of rather more
than 20 miles we had descended fully 1,000 feet, the height of the
<i>kasbah</i> above the sea being calculated at 2,367 feet. The
night had not been altogether pleasant, for, in spite of insect
powder, the bugs had made a vigorous and successful attack, and we
should have preferred to start at an earlier hour. But as usual
Kaïd el Hasbi stood in the way. He was quite determined not to let
the unbelieving strangers put him to the slightest inconvenience
that could be avoided.</p>

<p>Before we started the Governor sent Hooker a present of 20
dollars, which was of course immediately returned. The poor man
doubtless thought it well to lose no chance of propitiating any
influence that could possibly be of avail in the hour of future
need. With the same object, he took the opportunity of sending
through Abraham a dog to Mr. Carstensen at Mogador, and doubtless
made presents to the officers of our escort.</p>

<p>After leaving the <i>kasbah</i> we rode through a narrow belt of
tilled land, and soon reached the verge of a tract of open country
remaining in a state of nature, with but few and scattered traces
of population or cultivation. In some parts the soil was stony, and
the presence of <i>Arthrocnemum</i> and other Salsolaceous bushes
indicated the presence of soluble salts, but in others the absence
of cultivation was probably due only to the want of irrigation.
There can be little doubt that by a more skilful distribution of
the drainage from the northern slopes of the Great Atlas, the area
of land producing human food might be largely increased.</p>

<p>Our course lay between WSW. and SW., and we observed as we
advanced that in that direction the outer ranges of hills did not
rise so nearly parallel to the axis of the main chain as they do in
the districts lying between Tasseremout and Amsmiz. A very
considerable mass, extending northward as a promontory from the
main range, became gradually more conspicuous as we
advanced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> towards
it, while a minor mass lying much nearer to us was seen on our
left. About noon we approached the latter range in which the
stratification appeared very irregular with a prevailing southward
dip, and the strike NE. to SW. At its western extremity this range
showed a line of steep cliffs, reminding us of those near
Tasseremout, with the difference that the strata were here crumpled
or contorted in a remarkably uniform manner, the same curvature of
the folds being repeated nine or ten times. The compressing force
must here have operated nearly in the direction of the axis of the
main chain, and in a distance of some two miles the beds whose
exposed edges we viewed must have originally covered a space of
nearly twice that length.</p>

<p>As often happens when the air is nearly saturated with moisture,
the horizon was to-day remarkably clear, and we made out the
position of the city of Marocco, more than 40 miles distant, and
bearing nearly due NE. About due north, and not quite so distant,
rose the hills near Sheshaoua, and about midway between them a
remarkable conical hill seen from near Misra ben Kara.</p>

<p>Before 2 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> we approached a large
<i>kasbah</i> at a place called Douerani. When we afterwards
learned that this belonged to the same chief who hospitably
received M. Balansa, and assisted him in exploring the
neighbourhood until orders from Marocco cut his stay short, we had
some doubt whether this was not the place described by him as
Keira. An examination of his map and the account of his expedition
leads us, however, to the conclusion that Keira must be the name of
another habitation belonging to the same chief, lying a few miles
farther north, and that the mountain called Djebel Aït Ougurt,
ascended by M. Balansa, must be some eminence in the range near at
hand which we had just before been scrutinising. We now perceived
that there is a considerable valley or depression lying between
this outer range and the main mass of the Atlas, which is, indeed,
indicated in M. Balansa’s sketch map.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>Before long we
received a courteous message inviting us to stop at the
<i>kasbah</i>; but as it seemed clear that Seksaoua promised more
easy access to the higher mountains, we had no hesitation in
adhering to the plan already fixed, and declining the proffered
hospitality. It was not without regret that we adhered to our
resolution, when the chief came out with a numerous suite to visit
us at our halting-place close to the <i>kasbah</i>. The friendly
air of the worthy old man, which evidently made a deep impression
on M. Balansa, was not without effect upon us. Failing to induce us
to stop on our way, he sent an ample <i>mona</i>, including,
besides tea and sugar, a parcel of candles of French manufacture,
the more acceptable as our supply threatened to run short before we
could reach Mogador.</p>

<p>Our halting-place was in a pleasant spot overlooking the broad
bed of the Oued Usbi, which appears to unite the torrent from a
considerable valley south of Seksaoua with several minor streams
from the Atlas, and to be the main affluent of the river of
Sheshaoua. The weather had improved, and the thermometer stood at
about 70° F. in the shade, our height above the sea being 2,671
feet (814·3 m.). Spiny <i>Compositæ</i> belonging to the genera
<i>Scolymus</i>, <i>Echinops</i>, <i>Cnicus</i>, and
<i>Onopordum</i>, were the most conspicuous plants; but, as no
species not already gathered were seen here, we dispensed ourselves
from collecting and drying these troublesome inmates of the
herbarium.</p>

<p>It was near 4 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> when we started for
Seksaoua, and, after crossing the Oued Usbi, held on in a SW.
direction nearly parallel to its course. In little more than an
hour we came to a large village, which was the scene of unexpected
commotion. As our cavalcade was seen to approach, some natives ran
on to announce the fact to the villagers, and by the time we
reached the first houses the whole population turned out, and a
scene ensued of which no description can give an idea. The men who
lined the way on either side shouted with emulous vehemence
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span> fury guttural
sentences, illustrated by frantic gesticulations, while the women
and children kept up a deafening accompaniment of shrieking,
wailing, and howling, and the whole formed a scene worthy of
Pandemonium. It seemed sufficiently clear that no hostile
intentions against us were expressed, but amidst the horrible din
and confusion it was some minutes before we were able to learn from
Abraham the meaning of this wild excitement. It appeared that, as
constantly happens among the mountain people, there was a feud
between this and a neighbouring tribe; the village had been
attacked, or at least approached by the enemy, and one of the
villagers had been shot.</p>

<p>It was evident from the first that our brave escort felt
extremely uneasy; but when it became clear that the object of the
people was to invoke the protection of the soldiers of the Sultan
against further molestation, our two Kaïds for once thoroughly
agreed on a policy of strict neutrality, and in desiring to get as
soon as possible out of harm’s way. As for us, it may be feared
that we failed to maintain the gravity which, to the Oriental mind,
befits persons of distinction. Just when the confusion was at its
worst, and before we well understood what it portended, we happened
to look up to where on the top of the nearest house two or three
storks, each poised on one leg, were looking down on the frantic
crowd. There was something irresistibly ludicrous in the contrast
between the air of solemnity that characterises these birds and the
insane excitement of the human crowd below that set us off in a
peal of laughter, which we found it hard to tune down to decent
seriousness.</p>

<p>The uppermost anxiety of our escort being to get away from any
chance of being mixed up in the local troubles, they proposed to
push on as far as possible towards the mouth of the valley, and we
were all the better pleased to find ourselves as near as possible
to the mountains in which we still hoped to effect another
excursion. It was not, however, practicable to go far. About two
miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span> above the
village a rocky spur projects from the mass of the Atlas towards
the plain, and is backed by a mountain mass rising some 2,500 or
3,000 feet above the valley. At the eastern base of this rocky
promontory, in a stony field planted with young olive trees, we
pitched our tents on very rough ground, where it was not easy to
find a level spot to sleep upon, but where we promised ourselves
good botanising in the immediate neighbourhood, even if unable to
penetrate far into the mountains.</p>

<p>Some unusual precautions were taken this evening to guard
against a night attack upon our camp, and the Kaïds assumed an air
of importance befitting men who felt that the time had at length
arrived for a display of their professional skill and prowess; but,
as we fully expected, the night passed without the slightest
molestation. A few musket shots discharged at a distance were
heard, exchanged between the hostile parties, or more probably
fired <i>in terrorem</i> to show that the defenders were ready for
action. As we heard no more on the subject, it is probable that no
further disturbance ensued during our stay in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 26 our first anxiety was to ascertain what
might be our prospect of reaching from this point the head of the
valley, and making another ascent of the main range. We had already
heard rumours of disturbances among the native tribes in the upper
part of the valley, so that our expectations of success did not run
high; and when the sheik of the valley was forthcoming we were not
much surprised to hear him declare that an excursion in that
direction was utterly impracticable. We at once suspected Kaïd el
Hasbi of practising his usual machinations to defeat our
intentions; but with the difference that on this occasion there was
probably some foundation in fact for the tales that were told us of
conflicts between the neighbouring tribes, and of possible danger
for travellers. With an escort furnished by the orders of the
Sultan, and quite numerous enough to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_284">[284]</span> inspire respect among the rude
mountaineers, there would have been no real risk in proceeding
along the valley—or anywhere else in this part of the
country—provided we could have reckoned on our men; but in the face
of their refusal, there was no use in further pressing the
point.</p>

<p>The next thing to be done was to make an arrangement for
enabling us to see something of the outer range of mountains
immediately surrounding our camp, and after some debating it was
agreed that on the following day we should ascend to the higher
ridge of the considerable mass already referred to as rising to the
west of our camp. Much nearer at hand, extending from behind our
tents towards the opening of the main valley, a steep rocky ridge,
only from 400 to 500 feet in height, promised to show us what we
had hitherto seen little of, the rock vegetation of the lower
region of the Atlas, and we readily made up our minds to devote the
remainder of this day to its careful examination.</p>

<p>There was, however, another matter of a practical nature
requiring immediate attention. A glance at the map shows that in
travelling along the skirts of the Atlas from Seksaoua to Mogador
our route must lie through the district of Imintanout, and thence
through the adjoining provinces of Mtouga and Haha. We had informed
Mr. Carstensen of our intention to follow this line of route, and
fixed the probable date of our return to Mogador at the 2nd or 3rd
of June. During the last two days we had heard vague reports of
disturbances going on in the provinces of Mtouga and Haha, and
these were now confirmed and aggravated by the sheik of Seksaoua.
War was actually raging, we were told, and the Governors had
summoned all their people to arms. As was to be expected, the men
of our escort, who clearly had no stomach for fighting of any kind,
were becoming very uneasy at the idea of coming near to the seat of
operations, and we apprehended that they might make an attempt to
force us to diverge from our intended route and travel northward
across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> plain so
as to rejoin the beaten road from Marocco to Mogador. Having
ascertained that the distance from Seksaoua to the <i>kasbah</i> of
the Governor of Mtouga is no more than an easy day’s ride for men
travelling without luggage, Kaïd el Hadj of Mogador with two of his
men was despatched on a mission to Mtouga. He was to ascertain the
truth as to the stories that had reached us, and to require the
Governor, in case he considered extra protection necessary, to send
additional soldiers to escort us through his territory, thus, as we
hoped, committing us to keep to our intended route as far as
Mtouga.</p>

<p>About this time we became a good deal interested in one of the
soldiers of our escort who had travelled with us throughout our
journey. He was a large man, with black skin, but with hair and
lips of less pronounced Negro type than we see among the natives of
western equatorial Africa. When leaving Mogador he had an ulcerous
sore on one hand, which was much swollen and almost useless. The
sore, under Hooker’s treatment, was quite healed, and he was
genuinely grateful for the benefit. Alone among the soldiers of our
escort he did what he could to forward our desire to explore the
mountain valleys; and of late, on more than one occasion, he had
given useful information that helped us to defeat the petty
intrigues of Kaïd el Hasbi. By our direction Abraham made some
inquiry as to his previous history, and he quite readily told his
story. He belonged, as it appeared, to one of the tribes that
inhabit the skirts of the Great Desert on the south side of the
Great Atlas. They led a predatory life, gaining an uncertain living
by robbing travellers, and killing those who made resistance. After
some years passed in this way, our friend seemed to have taken a
dislike to the mode of life, and enlisted as a soldier in the
service of the Sultan of Marocco. In his new position he had gained
or developed some elementary notions of religion and morality, and
he now expressed a strong opinion as to the impropriety of robbery
and murder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span>Here was a case
such as is often cited by superficial travellers to show the
absence of a moral sense among savage people. This man had no doubt
robbed and murdered in his youth without the slightest compunction;
but, given the conditions under which the ethical sense could be
developed, the result was to produce an individual morally superior
to the majority of those around him. The analogy, so well drawn by
Reid, between the moral nature of man and the development of the
plant from the seed holds good. External conditions are necessary;
but they do not create the germ, without which no evolution can
follow. The conditions vary from one individual to another. One
requires to be fostered by many favourable influences; another,
with stronger vitality, will bud forth under the least auspicious
conditions. The assertion that there are human beings in whom it is
impossible to awaken any sense of difference between right and
wrong must be, at least, premature, until the world shall have
reached a social condition in which each individual may be tried
under appropriate conditions.</p>

<p>Our day’s botanising on the rocks near Seksaoua was successful
beyond our expectations. Many conspicuous plants peculiar to
Marocco were here seen for the first time. Several of these had
been gathered by M. Balansa during the four days which he passed in
the adjoining district of Keira, but were known to us only by name.
That active and successful botanical traveller was able to collect
so few specimens that in several cases no duplicates were available
for distribution, and the specimens exist only in the rich
herbarium of M. Cosson. Among other novelties we here saw for the
first time <i>Trachelium angustifolium</i> of Schousboe, utterly
unlike any other species of that ornamental genus; <i>Teucrium
rupestre</i> and <i>T. bullatum</i>, both described by M. Cosson
from Balansa’s specimens; and a single specimen of <i>Elæoselinum
exinvolucratum</i> of Cosson, a fine umbelliferous plant,
apparently very rare even in its native<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_287">[287]</span> district. A very fine <i>Brassica</i>,
standing five or six feet high, with a straight upright stem, set
with candelabrum-like branches, was the most remarkable new plant
found by us which had not already come in the way of M.
Balansa.</p>

<p>The morning had been cool; the thermometer at 8 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> did not rise above 64° F., and the sky was
overclouded; but as the day went on the sun blazed out with great
power, and this was one of the hottest days we experienced. The
heat was, of course, especially felt on bare rocks which became so
hot that the hand could not bear them; and the soldier who had gone
out by way of protecting us judiciously retired to the shade of a
fig-tree at the foot of the hill. After some time, we separated and
returned to the camp by different routes. A portion of the slope
not far above our camp was altogether covered with broken blocks of
moderate size obviously derived from the steeper crags above. This
ground abounded in reptiles of various kinds, which were, however,
so shy that it was not easy to get a favourable view of them. By
sitting perfectly still for some minutes, Ball was partly
successful in getting them to approach him. The most remarkable
creature much resembled a miniature Iguanodon in form, being about
eighteen inches long, with a row of thick conical processes
projecting upwards along the back, and gradually diminishing
towards the tail from about two inches in height between the
shoulders. Numerous lizards were also seen; but no snakes, except a
small black viperine species, seen gliding between the stones,
actually under one foot, which fortunately did not touch or injure
the animal.</p>

<p>By this time we were beginning to feel the effects of the
unsatisfactory dietary to which we had been reduced during the four
weeks since we left Mogador. It may seem unreasonable for men in
health, plentifully supplied with fowls, sheep, and eggs, to
complain of their food; but those who have experienced the
difference between the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_288">[288]</span> meat of well-fed animals and the stringy
tasteless fibre which is produced in such a country as this, will
duly appreciate our longing for some variety. As the season
advanced, and the herbage in the lower country became more and more
parched, the sheep, always miserably thin, approached nearer and
nearer to the condition of skeletons, covered with skin and ragged
wool, and for some time back we had given up the attempt to eat any
part, except the liver and kidneys broiled on short sticks; while
the fowls had become equally distasteful. The <i>keskossou</i>,
daily presented with the <i>mona</i>, was prepared with large
quantities of rancid butter, to which, in spite of many
experiments, we never could reconcile ourselves. Our attempts at
obtaining any variety of diet were quite unsuccessful. Ducks and
geese, being by Mohammedans considered unclean, were out of the
question; and the turkey and guinea-fowl appear to be unknown to
the domestic economy of the Moors. Our chief desideratum was fresh
vegetables or fruit, but these were not to be obtained. Except in
the neighbourhood of the coast towns, where they have been
introduced by Europeans, none of our European vegetables are
cultivated in South Marocco, except the cucumber and the pumpkin,
and, owing to the want of the most elementary skill in
horticulture, these seem to remain in season for a very short time;
while the cultivation of fruit, at least in the districts we
traversed, seems to be generally neglected. In this respect Marocco
presents a striking contrast to most places with a somewhat similar
climate in the Mediterranean region. Egypt, Palestine, and Syria,
however low they may have fallen owing to corrupt and oppressive
government, have retained some share in the inheritance of an
ancient civilisation. We had carried with us sundry tins of
preserved vegetables, of which green peas were by far the most
acceptable; but our stores were now nearly exhausted, and our chief
remaining luxury was portable soup, made with compressed vegetables
and biscuits, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
was now served out very sparingly. Tea without milk was often
pleasant in the evening; but cocoa, prepared with milk in small
tins, was much preferred for the morning meal.</p>

<p>The evening air was cool and pleasant, and, in spite of the
advancing season, the night almost cold, though the height of our
station, by the mean of two observations, did not exceed 2,867 feet
(874 m.). Even the horrible howling of the dogs in a neighbouring
village failed to keep us from a good night’s rest.</p>

<p>The morning of May 27 broke brilliantly, and, though the sun’s
rays were already hot, the thermometer in the shade at 6
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span> did not rise above 60° F. Another
attempt was made to induce the sheik to take us for an excursion up
the main valley; but he held fast to his declaration that the
country in that direction was too dangerous, and repeated his offer
of the previous day to lead us up the nearer mountain. Failing
anything better, we resolved to accept this.</p>

<p>The declivity of the hill immediately west of our camp being
much too steep for horses, we followed a circuitous track, at first
NW. and then SSW., chiefly along steep slopes, on which, among
other novelties, we first gathered <i>Erodium atlanticum</i>,
discovered in this district by M. Balansa. After an ascent of some
1,500 or 1,600 feet the track turned again nearly due west, and we
found ourselves on the southern slope of the mountain, which we now
saw to be almost completely detached from the main range of the
Atlas. The slightly convex ridge on which we stood inclined gently
to the south, forming the watershed between the Seksaoua valley and
that of Imintanout which adjoins it on the west. The slopes of the
mountains enclosing both those valleys are better wooded than usual
in the Atlas, some variety of evergreen oak being apparently the
prevailing tree. Behind us, as we stood facing the great range, the
mountain rose some 1,200 feet above our present level, and as the
sun was hot we did not immediately<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_290">[290]</span> dismount, but continued to ride some part
of the way, only the final ascent being made on foot.</p>

<p>The view was in many respects very interesting, as it showed us
a great part of the main range from an entirely new point of view,
and the air on this day was unusually clear. Looking westward,
where the horizon, at a distance of at least eighty miles, must
have been rather near the Atlantic coast, we were able to assure
ourselves that the hills that extend through most of the great
province of Haha are all of moderate height, none of them
approaching that on which we stood. In this respect Beaudouin’s map
is much more correct than that of Gerhard Rohlfs, which seems to
show that the main chain at its western end is broken up into
lofty, diverging branches, some of which extend far through Haha.
No prominent object caught the eye to the northward, except the
familiar flat-topped hills near Sheshaoua. For the last time we
were able to distinguish the site of the city of Marocco, bearing
about NE. by E., and over sixty miles distant. About due east the
high range at the head of the Aït Mesan valley showed much more
snow than when we viewed it five days before from the summit of
Djebel Tezah, while the latter mountain seemed pretty much in the
same condition in which we had found it. About due south a rugged
peak towards the head of the Imintanout valley had snow in rifts
and depressions; and another of somewhat similar aspect, rising
farther east and above the head of the Seksaoua valley, seemed to
be the highest point in the whole range west of the sources of the
Oued Nfys. From their position, and the ruggedness of their aspect,
either of these peaks promised well for a naturalist who could
succeed in gaining access to them, but we felt that such good
fortune was not now in store for us.</p>

<p>The fresh sheet of snow which had fallen on the Aït Mesan range
within the last few days led us to what seemed an explanation of
the inconsistent accounts given as well by travellers as by natives
as to the existence of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_291">[291]</span> perpetual snow on this part of the Great
Atlas. From its position between the Great Desert to the south, the
Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the low country to the north, it is
obvious that a range of mountains from 11,000 to 13,000 feet in
height must frequently be the seat of violent atmospheric
disturbances. Whenever these draw from the ocean currents of heated
air, nearly saturated with moisture, into the upper region, the
cooling effect consequent on rapid expansion must produce copious
precipitation, and it is most probable that on the higher part of
the range this, even in the hottest season, takes the form of snow.
But, as we had seen, the snow melts with extreme rapidity under the
almost vertical sun during the summer months; and hence one
traveller may have seen the range thickly snowed even in the
hottest season, while another, with equal truth, may describe it as
almost completely bare. The state of things is such that a very
moderate change in the physical conditions might easily lead to the
accumulation of an annual surplus of unmelted snow, which is the
first condition for the formation of glaciers. A mere increase in
the amount of precipitation, with little change in the general
conditions of temperature of this region, might produce glaciers
reaching as low down as that whose moraine we saw at the head of
the Aït Mesan valley.</p>

<p>Many early-flowering plants were already withered, but we
collected on the mountain several interesting species. Of two tall
and very distinct <i>Resedas</i> found here, one is also a native
of Spain; the other, <i>R. elata</i>, of Cosson, was first gathered
by M. Balansa, and seems to be confined to this district. Of
another curious plant discovered by the same active naturalist we
now first saw satisfactory specimens. It is at first sight scarcely
to be distinguished from a species characteristic of the hot and
dry region of North Africa—the <i>Cynara acaulis</i> of Linnæus.
The latter was discovered by Tilli, a Florentine physician,
afterwards professor of botany at Pisa, who was<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> called to Constantinople early
in the last century to cure the favourite daughter of the Sultan.
Being successful in his treatment, he received many tokens of
favour, and seems to have made use of his opportunities to visit
several parts of the Turkish Empire, and certainly travelled in the
Regency of Tunis. The same plant was next seen by the English
traveller, Thomas Shaw, who mentions it in the Appendix to his
Travels published in 1738; and it was at last more fully described
and well figured by Desfontaines in his excellent work, the
<i>Flora Atlantica</i>. Decandolle, in attempting to reduce to
order the vast mass of plants that belong to the natural order of
<i>Compositæ</i>, clearly saw that this differed essentially from
the genus <i>Cynara</i> (of which the type is the common
artichoke), and referred it first to <i>Serratula</i>, and finally
to <i>Rhaponticum</i>; and it has hence been generally known as
<i>Rhaponticum acaule</i>. Many botanists were somewhat startled to
find in the <i>Genera Plantarum</i> of Bentham and Hooker that the
authors had united all the plants hitherto ranked under the generic
name <i>Rhaponticum</i> with <i>Centaurea</i>, a vast genus,
containing species of the most varied aspect, of which nearly 300
are already known in the Mediterranean region. It was interesting
to us to find that the new species discovered by Balansa, of which
the foliage is quite undistinguishable from the old <i>Rhaponticum
acaule</i>, is, as regards the flowering heads, intermediate in
structure between that and recognised species of <i>Centaurea</i>,
though nearer to the latter. If we had remembered Shaw’s statement,
that the roots of his <i>Cynara acaulis</i> have an agreeable
flavour, and are eaten by the Arabs in some parts of Africa, we
should certainly have tried whether the species are also similar in
this respect.</p>

<p>During the ascent of the mountain we had passed near a little
hamlet, containing eight or ten houses of the poorest class; but
the laws of native hospitality required that refreshments should be
offered to the strangers, and on the way back a halt was called.
The <i>mona</i> consisted of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_293">[293]</span> eggs, wheaten cakes, butter, and milk,
which were speedily despatched; and we added to our collections a
curious biennial variety of <i>Rumex vesicarius</i>, having the
membranous wings enclosing the fruit of a bright rose red.</p>

<p>By 4 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> we had got back to our camp,
and the remainder of the day was devoted to the care of our
collections. Before nightfall Kaïd el Hadj returned from his
mission to Mtouga, bringing confirmation of the reports as to the
outbreak of hostilities between the people of Mtouga and their
neighbours of Haha, with an addition to our escort in the shape of
six ragged-looking soldiers sent by the Governor of Mtouga.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 28 our numbers were further increased by
the return of the two soldiers who had left us at Sektana for the
purpose of escorting Maw to Mogador. They were welcome, for they
brought letters from England, together with a good account of our
travelling companion. He had reached Mogador early on the fifth day
from Sektana, and happened to arrive a few hours before the
departure of a small British steamer bound from the Canary Islands
to London.</p>

<p>Before departing, we gave a last look at the neighbourhood of
our camp, and reluctantly abstained from attempting a close
examination of the ancient castle, or fort, which stood at the
opposite side of the stream commanding the entrance to the main
valley. We were well aware that any curiosity shown in that
direction would have been set down to designs on buried treasure,
and would have aggravated the suspicion with which all our
proceedings were viewed by the native authorities.</p>

<p>We did not start until 10 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>, and
with an unusually long cavalcade followed a faintly marked track
that winds round the northern base of the mountain which we had
ascended on the preceding day, gradually attaining to a height of
several hundred feet above the plain. Before long we crossed the
borders of Imintanout, a district including several villages under
a sheik who is dependent on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_294">[294]</span> the Governor of Haha. Through the valley,
which here opens out, lies the main road from Marocco to Tarudant,
the chief town of Sous. Jackson, who seems to have gained the
especial favour of the reigning Emperor, received, about the
beginning of this century, permission to accompany a military force
despatched from Marocco to Tarudant, and no other European is known
to have traversed this part of the Atlas.<a id=
"FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Unfortunately his account of the expedition is limited to the
statement that the way lies through a narrow defile, where the path
cut in the rock is only 15 inches wide, with the mountain rising
almost perpendicularly on one side, and on the other a precipice
‘as steep as Dover cliff, but more than ten times the height.’ It
would have been a matter of great interest to us to make a short
excursion up the valley, and to penetrate this defile, but once
more we were doomed to disappointment. The sheik, having notice of
our approach, met us near to what seemed the chief village. His
language and manner were quite friendly, but he declared that it
was quite impossible for us to enter the valley. Fighting, as he
declared, was actually going on between the mountain tribes, those
of Ida Mahmoud, to the east of the valley, taking part with Mtouga,
and those of Ida Ziki, on the west side, holding with Haha. It was
impossible to get any reliable information as to the nature of the
country along the mountain road. According to one informant the
distance to Tarudant may be traversed in two days, while another
declared that time to be necessary to reach the summit of the pass.
It seems certain that the main chain in approaching its western
termination has a less regular structure than in the part nearer
Marocco. It throws out numerous diverging ridges; the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> peaks, while inferior in
absolute height, are more isolated; and the valleys, or at least
that of Imintanout, now opening in front of us, seem to be more
deeply excavated. We certainly heard the names of the two mountains
mentioned above, which appear on Beaudouin’s map; but no name at
all resembling Djebel Aithadius, which M. Balansa gives for one of
the higher snow-seamed peaks in this part of the range.</p>

<p>We were here again struck by the difficulty of catching the
sounds from native lips, a feat to be achieved only by repeated
trials. At a first essay two Europeans will often write down a name
in ways so utterly different that they cannot be recognised as
intended to represent the same sound. Though some of the Shelluhs
understand and use the word <i>Gebel</i> (or <i>Djebel</i>) for a
mountain, the native word, at least in this district, seems to be
certainly <i>Ida</i>, probably connected with <i>Idrarn</i>, the
plural form of <i>Adrar</i>, a mountain. Idrarn Drann is the name
given by the Shelluhs to the whole, or some considerable portion,
of the Atlas range; and etymologists, when they come to know more
of the Bereber dialects, may consider whether the name Dyris, by
which this part of the Atlas was known to the Romans, is connected
with the same root. Captain Beaudouin, the author of the French
map, seems to have been misled by natives of this region, who would
sometimes call a great mountain well known to them by the generic
name <i>Ida</i>, and sometimes by a special local name, and was
thus led to consider these as alternative names. Thus he writes the
names of three mountains, Ida <i>ou</i> Ziki, Ida <i>ou</i>
Mahmoud, and Ida <i>ou</i> Mahmed.</p>

<p>When it was clear that nothing was here to be effected in the
way of mountain exploration, and it was seen that the day was too
far gone to reach Mtouga, we decided on proceeding to Milhaïn, a
place, as we were told, standing close to the foot of the
mountains. Only a slender stream which we crossed, issues from the
valley above Imintanout, and conflicting statements were made as to
the course of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span> this,
as well as of the other stream which we saw somewhat later at
Milhaïn. In ordinary weather both are probably absorbed into
irrigation channels before they traverse the plain; but it is most
likely that their natural course, which they must follow in rainy
weather, joins that of the Oued Usbi flowing from Seksaoua, and
reaches the Oued Tensift by the way of Sheshaoua.</p>

<p>An easy ride of two hours took us to Milhaïn. The outer skirts
of the Atlas here had an unexpectedly bare and sterile aspect. We
had supposed that in the portion of the range approaching the
Atlantic coast a more copious rainfall would produce more luxuriant
vegetation. We were now within about 70 miles of the ocean, but, as
compared with the valleys south of Marocco, the change had been in
the opposite sense. It may well be that owing to the diminished
height of the mountains the cooling of the aërial currents from the
W. and SW. is here insufficient to cause much rain, except in
winter, or possibly this part of the range is more exposed to hot
and dry winds from the desert. It may also be true that the
difference in the vegetation is largely due to the mineral
structure of the rocks in this district. They chiefly consist of
hard brittle semi-crystalline limestone, with softer beds
intercalated, and the rainfall must be very rapidly absorbed in
crevices and fissures. No trees were to be seen, except olives
planted near the villages, and a few white poplars near the banks
of the stream beside which we pitched our camp.</p>

<p>We were fully prepared for the assurance of the village sheik
that the condition of the country made it impossible for him to
conduct us into the valley which here issues from the Great Atlas,
and sends down a stream rather more considerable than that of
Imintanout; and, as it was clearly useless to press the point, we
contented ourselves by expressing a wish to take a short walk into
a recess of the mountain enclosed between steep rocky declivities
that opened within sight of our camp. A jocund young Shelluh was
appointed as a guide, though none in reality<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_297">[297]</span> was required; and he somewhat interested
us by singing lustily at the top of his voice songs of a lively
character. Hitherto all the mountaineers we had met were marked by
a serious and somewhat saddened demeanour, as of people on whom the
burden of life pressed heavily, the only exceptions being among the
men we had brought from Mogador, of whom Ambak was especially
noticeable for his cheerful and lively humour.</p>

<p>The outer slopes of the hills about Milhaïn were scantily clad
with a meagre vegetation, in which a woolly variety of <i>Ononis
Natrix</i>, <i>Helianthemum virgatum</i>, some variety of the
ubiquitous <i>Teucrium Polium</i> and <i>Macrochloa tenacissima</i>
were the prevailing species; and the attempts at tillage seemed to
produce only miserable crops of barley. We expected to find more
variety on the rocks which were before us, and were not altogether
disappointed; but the season was already far advanced, and the
spring vegetation partially dried up. Along the dry bed of the
streamlet, that is probably filled only after heavy rain, we
gathered <i>Euphorbia pinea</i>, not before seen in Marocco. On the
dry rocks we found a curious form of <i>Coronilla viminalis</i>,
reduced to a stunted bush, scarcely two feet high, with its curious
jointed pods, four or five inches in length. A range of quite
vertical crags was almost covered with two peculiar plants of this
region—<i>Euphorbia rimarum</i>, of Cosson, and <i>Andrachne
maroccana</i>, of Ball. The latter, though abundantly different in
structure, has much the habit of <i>A. telephioides</i>, the
wide-spread Mediterranean species. In a crevice of these rocks a
single small specimen of the rare fern, <i>Asplenium Petrarchæ</i>,
was also found.</p>

<p>The hill opposite that which we ascended was crowned by a fort,
similar in character to those which we had seen elsewhere on the
skirts of the Atlas, to which our Shelluh guide gave the name
Taganagurt. Our involuntary change of route prevented us from
ascertaining whether these extend westward along the northern base
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> mountains in
the direction of Agadir, but this is probable. Future travellers
may be able to ascertain more about them than we were able to do.
To whatever date their construction be referred, it is clear that
they were erected either by the people inhabiting the low country
to restrain the incursions of mountain tribes, or by the latter to
repel attacks on their independence, the former being, in our
opinion, the more probable opinion.</p>

<p>We returned to camp between 5 and 6 <span class=
"sc2">P.M.</span>, and found that a courier from Mogador had
arrived with letters from Mr. Carstensen. The whole province of
Haha was, he assured us, in a most disturbed state; and besides,
the war with Mtouga was complicated by the insurrection of some of
the tribes in Haha against the authority of their own Governor. He
strongly urged that we should abandon the intention of travelling
along the skirts of the Atlas through Haha, and make up our minds
to return from Mtouga by way of Shedma, telling us that he proposed
to meet us at the <i>kasbah</i> of the Governor of that province on
the last day of May. We were very loth to forego the promise of
seeing a district new to travellers, and far more interesting than
any lying on the direct way from Mtouga to Mogador; but we felt it
impossible to persevere in the face of Mr. Carstensen’s strong
opposition. It was, indeed, open to question whether, under the
ægis of the Sultan’s protection, we might not without serious risk
have carried out our original intention. Whatever might be the
intestine troubles of the country, it could not suit any of the
contending parties to provoke encounter with the paramount
authority of the Sultan; but we felt that we had no right to take a
course directly opposed to the advice of the official
representative of our Government, and especially of one to whom we
felt under so many obligations.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> partial failure of our
plans doubtless had a depressing effect on the morning of May 29,
and this was increased by the aspect of the weather, which was
misty, and before long turned to fine, drizzling rain. At 8
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span> the thermometer stood at 58° F., and
we found the height above the sea of our camp at Milhaïn to be
3,397 feet (1,035·3 metres). We were in no hurry to start; but, as
the rain grew lighter and finally ceased, we got under way about 11
<span class="sc2">A.M.</span> The sheik, who had provided for our
wants and those of our escort on a liberal scale, escorted us for a
short distance, and we parted with friendly expressions on both
sides.</p>

<p>Our course lay somewhat west of due north, over a bare and
sterile country. Small hamlets, surrounded by a narrow belt of
cultivation, were seen at rather wide intervals; and, save a few
olive trees near the houses, we did not pass a single tree during
the day. <i>Artemisia Herba-alba</i>, and <i>Chenopodiaceæ</i> of
the <i>Salsola</i> tribe, were the prevailing plants, indicating
the presence of gypsum and of soluble salts in the soil. About
three o’clock we approached a large village, with a massive square
<i>kasbah</i>, and soon after, following a dry
watercourse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
entered the singular defile which, as well as the village, is known
by the name Aïn Tarsil. It has evidently been formed by erosion
from the limestone strata which dip slightly towards the south. The
surrounding country here shows a hilly undulating surface, unbroken
by any marked inequalities; but the stream, though dry in ordinary
weather, has cut a trench from two to three miles in length, and
from thirty to fifty feet in width, between steep walls of rock
about equal in height to the width of the trench.</p>

<p>M. Balansa, the only traveller who is known to have passed
through this defile, must have been more hurried than we were, as
he does not speak of the numerous rare and local plants which grow
upon the rocks, most of them, indeed, the same that we had found on
the rocks about Seksaoua. But he could not avoid being struck by
the singular excavations in the rock, evidently used at some remote
period for human habitation, which extend at intervals along both
sides of the defile. In some cases there may have been a natural
recess in the rock, afterwards artificially enlarged; but the
majority appear to be altogether the work of human hands; and in
most of them, where the entrance had become difficult owing to the
breaking away of pieces of rock from the edge, this was afterwards
made good by building up a bit of loose wall of irregular blocks of
stone. The height of the entrance does not exceed four feet, and is
often less. The most singular point about these dwellings is the
fact that they are all near the top of the cliff, where the rock is
nearly vertical, in positions that cannot now be reached without a
ladder, or other artificial assistance. It might be suggested that
since these prehistoric dwellings were abandoned, the work of
erosion has deepened the trench, and thus increased the difficulty
of access; but unless we suppose that during the same period the
climatal conditions have been profoundly modified, this seems a
highly improbable explanation. As far as we could
afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span> judge,
the watercourse running through the defile receives the drainage of
only a small tract of hill country, and the marks of water action
do not extend to the rocks on either side. It is impossible to see
these remains without being reminded of the notions current in
antiquity as to troglodytes who dwelt in the neighbourhood of the
Atlas mountains, and who could run faster than horses;<a id=
"FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
but until the dwellings can be carefully examined, all speculation
as to their date and origin must be vague and unreliable. It seems
most probable that the rude savages who fashioned them for their
own use deliberately chose positions offering the best security
against attack, either from human enemies or wild beasts. Whether
to facilitate entrance they used a rude ladder, such as the notched
trunk of a tree, or relied on the superior climbing power which the
freer use of the foot confers on most savage people, must remain
uncertain.</p>

<p>As usual in this country the Moors refer these, as well as all
other antique remains, to the ‘Christians,’ and stories of
concealed treasure connected with all such monuments, of whatever
date, make it almost impossible to attempt to explore or examine
them. The work can be undertaken only by a traveller authorised by
a special order of the Sultan, who should also be prepared by
handsome presents to secure the goodwill of the local
authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span>We halted for
luncheon in a convenient spot, and gave some time to botanising on
the rocks, where, along with other plants, we found a beautiful
variety of the <i>Stachys saxicola</i> of Cosson, densely covered
with very long, white, silky hairs. It was near to five o’clock
before we were again under way. For some time the defile continued,
the cliff-like walls still showing at intervals excavated rock
dwellings, and at one point it receives a tributary stream, with a
bed now dry, which had cut a similar trench, and whose cliffs also
showed the traces of rock dwellings. As we advanced, always
ascending, we gradually emerged from the defile, and found
ourselves on the slope of the hills that extend northward from the
base of the Great Atlas for a distance of thirty or forty miles,
and are probably continuous with the low range that we crossed
between Shedma and Aïn Oumast. There must be some change hereabouts
in the mineral composition of the limestone rock, if not in its
geological age; as from about this point the surface was much less
barren, and the vegetation more varied. Among other fine
<i>Cynaraceæ</i> we saw here <i>Atractylis macrophylla</i> of
Desfontaines, only once before met in our journey.</p>

<p>The sky was overcast, and evening coming on, when we reached the
summit-level, which by our observations is 3,905 feet (1,190·2 m.)
above the sea-level.<a id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It did not appear to us that the
surrounding hills anywhere rise more than 200 or 300 feet above the
point where we passed, and, as we afterwards assured ourselves,
they gradually diminish in height as they stretch northward from
the main range of the Atlas. Although the matter is not free from
doubt, we incline to agree with M. Balansa in believing that the
hills we had now crossed form the watershed between the affluents
of the stream running northward by Sheshaoua, and those of the Oued
Kseb, which reaches the sea close to Mogador.
Beaudouin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> map,
usually correct as regards the accessible parts of the country,
represents things quite otherwise; according to him all the
drainage of this district is carried NNW. by a stream which passes
east of the Djebel Hadid, and reaches the sea between Mogador and
the mouth of the Oued Tensift; while the Oued Kseb, or Oued el
Ghored of Beaudouin, has a course of only some twenty miles, and
drains but a small tract of country near the coast. In most
countries such a question would admit of no doubt; but, between
absorption by irrigation and loss by evaporation, the streams in
South Marocco dwindle away on their course so fast, that only at
certain seasons it is possible to trace their course. As now
advised, we believe that many considerable streams unite in the
Oued Kseb, although this, at its mouth, is a mere trickling
rivulet, unable to keep a definite course through the Mogador sands
to the sea; while the stream laid down east of the Djebel Hadid has
not, so far as we could ascertain, any real existence.</p>

<p>A large flowered form of <i>Nigella arvensis</i>, with a few
other plants which we had not seen since we approached the
mountains, indicated a change in the soil, now much less barren as
we descended the north-west slope of the hills; and as twilight had
set in we reached the <i>kasbah</i> of the Governor of Mtouga, a
large pile surrounded by lofty stone walls. The soldiers, who had
ridden forward to announce our approach, found for some time no
response to their summons at the gate; and it was after some delay
that two or three slaves presented themselves, and we then learned
that the Governor and all his men had gone forth to fight against
their enemies from Haha. No orders had been given for our
entertainment; but we were told that within the enclosure of the
<i>kasbah</i> there were rooms which were at our disposal. Our
brave escort at once grasped at the prospect of shelter and safety
within the walls, and were urgent that we should at once decide on
accepting the offer. On inspecting the room to which he<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span> was conducted, Hooker had no
difficulty, however, in at once refusing the proffered
accommodation, and the alternative course of pitching our tents
within the enclosure, on ground constantly trodden by cattle, was
equally uninviting. Much to the trouble of our followers, the order
finally went forth that the tents should be pitched on some
moderately level ground outside the <i>kasbah</i>.</p>

<p>Slowly and sulkily the order was obeyed, we meanwhile sitting on
our horses, while the night fell gloomily around us. There was no
real ground for the uneasiness which our people undoubtedly felt,
as night attacks are quite foreign to the usages of the country;
but there was a genuine feeling that the Mtouga people were greatly
overmatched in their struggle with the Haha tribes, three or four
times more numerous than themselves. In the absence of supper every
ear was on the alert for the approach of some one with tidings of
the fray. At last, about 9 o’clock two men appeared; whether they
had taken part in the fight, or judiciously taken flight, did not
clearly appear. They claimed a victory for Mtouga, declaring that
eighteen men of Haha had been killed, and that many prisoners had
been taken, while acknowledging that the victors had also suffered
losses. Half an hour later the main body approached, but it was
soon evident that the return was anything rather than a triumph.
The night was too dark to take account of the whole number that
passed by our camp, or to observe their countenances; but the
Governor with a good many mounted soldiers, and a file of from
twenty to thirty prisoners tied together to bring up the rear,
passed close before our tent, and the dark outline of each figure
against the sky passed in long succession before us.</p>

<p>There was something weird and uncanny in the deep silence of the
nocturnal procession. The Governor, wrapped up in a white
<i>haik</i>, did not turn his head, or seem to notice the
strangers, and his followers copied his demeanour. Not a sound was
uttered until the file of prisoners passed by, when one man made a
sudden rush<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> towards
us, imploring our protection. Of course the attempt was vain, for
they were all securely tied together, and each end of the rope was
held by a mounted soldier. With many a blow and curse the wretched
man was driven along to share the fate of his companions in
captivity.</p>

<p>A little later came a message from the Governor, excusing
himself for not coming in person to see us. He owned to having lost
many of his men during the day’s encounter, and said he was too
anxious and disturbed to be able to entertain us. An ample
<i>mona</i> was at the same time sent, and this helped to restore
comparative cheerfulness among our followers.</p>

<p>As was natural under the circumstances we were anxious for
information, but Abraham was not able to learn any reliable
particulars as to the proceedings of the day. He professed,
however, to be well acquainted with the method of warfare carried
on between these turbulent tribes. The fighting consists in
irregular skirmishes by men who keep as far as possible under
cover, in which large quantities of powder are consumed with
comparatively insignificant results. But, whatever be the result,
it is a point of honour with each party to bring back prisoners. It
is not often that these are made among the fighting men. Harmless
peasants are seized—if of the enemy’s tribe so much the better;
but, if these are not to be had, those of their own tribe are made
the victims. We were assured that the same thing happens with the
Sultan’s troops on the rather frequent occasions when they are
despatched against some refractory mountain tribe. The mountaineers
commonly make good their retreat to some spot not easily reached by
horsemen; but, in order to be able to announce a victory, the
detachment seizes any hapless people that come in their way on
their return to the capital. When we inquired as to the destiny of
the captives it was horrible to be told that some of them would
certainly be butchered during the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[306]</span>It is strange,
although similar anomalies are found in all ages and countries, to
learn that, along with an utter absence of rudimentary feelings of
humanity, these people show indications of the sentiment of
chivalry. However strangely understood, the point of honour has a
recognised place in their ethical system. The feud between Haha and
Mtouga had been smouldering for many weeks, and hostilities were to
have commenced soon after our arrival in the country. But the
brother of the Kaïd of Haha was about that time seized with
small-pox, and it was thought proper to await his recovery before
commencing the war.</p>

<p>The night was overclouded, dark, and almost cold, and we were on
foot at an early hour on the morning of May 30. The <i>kasbah</i>,
standing on an elevated plateau, 3,085 feet (940·3 metres) above
the sea-level, does not, owing to the undulating character of the
surface, command any extensive view. Close beside it, a stream from
the Atlas has excavated a broad trench, similar in structure to Aïn
Tarsil, but very different in aspect. A streamlet here meanders
along the flat bottom between walls of rock some 40 feet in height,
and the more constant supply of moisture suffices to cover the
floor of the miniature valley with a carpet of vegetation, and to
support a fringe of tall water plants along the banks. We might
probably have added several species to our lists if we could have
devoted a day to botanising along the course of the stream; but in
the existing state of the country that could not be thought of, and
we contented ourselves with a morning stroll over the ground
surrounding the <i>kasbah</i>, and along the neighbouring banks of
the stream. As we wandered separately, Hooker was assailed with
extraordinary vehemence by a negro woman. Not a word could, of
course, be understood; but the objurgations of a virago are to some
extent intelligible in every language. It was not possible to guess
what induced this outpouring of threats and abuse, but it seemed
probable that a botanist might<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_307">[307]</span> unconsciously have done something to clash
with the superstitious feelings of the natives. It is clear that
the religion of Mohammed reaches but skin deep with the Bereber
population, while traditional observances, derived from far more
ancient religious systems, are still deeply rooted among them.</p>

<p>Much to the relief of our escort, whose first anxiety was to get
away from the troubled district, we started about 10 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> The Kaïd sent another message, again excusing
himself from a personal interview. We afterwards learned that he
had made a present of four dollars to each of our escort, of course
with the object of procuring some degree of support and countenance
at head-quarters.</p>

<p>Our course during the day lay between NW. and NNW., keeping for
a short distance along the course of the stream. At two or three
points we saw traces of rock dwellings, not nearly so well
preserved as those of Aïn Tarsil. Before long the walls of rock
subsided on each side of the stream, which bent in a westerly
direction, while our track ascended gently amid undulating downs,
till we reached a point commanding a wide unbroken view of the
northern horizon. To the eye the country before us seemed almost a
dead level, but there is a decided general slope from south to
north, as we more fully ascertained in the evening, when we found
that we had descended fully 1,500 feet during the day’s ride. The
outline of the Iron Mountain (Djebel Hadid) was now clearly
traceable in the distance, the highest part bearing about due NW.
As we advanced there was a manifest improvement in the fertility of
the soil, and for a space of five or six miles we rode amidst
cultivated fields, apparently the most productive that we had seen
in South Marocco. The same conditions necessarily affected the wild
plants of the country, and made it difficult to secure specimens of
manageable dimensions of several interesting species. A great
<i>Daucus</i> (<i>D. maximus</i> of Desfontaines), probably a
luxuriant form, or sub-species, of the common<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_308">[308]</span> carrot, grew to a height of four or five
feet, and the flowering umbels were often more than a foot in
diameter. More ornamental was a splendid <i>Centaurea</i>, three or
four feet high, with very large heads of deep orange flowers, often
tinged with purple, which we took to be altogether new. Subsequent
examination made it doubtful whether it should be separated from a
very variable North African species, <i>C. incana</i> of
Desfontaines, though much larger in all its parts, and differing in
the colour of the flowers.</p>

<p>We halted for luncheon near a village called Hazarar Assa,
standing, as we were assured, at the frontier, between the
provinces of Mtouga and Shedma. In Beaudouin’s map those provinces
are separated by an intervening strip of territory, apparently
belonging to the Ouled Bou Sba tribe. As political divisions in
this country are subject to frequent alteration, the map may have
been correct at the time it was made.</p>

<p>Maize was grown near the village, although no means for
irrigation were apparent. As the growth of this plant is in general
absolutely dependent on a frequent supply of water to the soil, we
could only infer that we had come within the limits of the coast
climate, and that as a general rule rain cannot there be very
unfrequent during the months of April, May, and June.</p>

<p>During the halt the villagers reported that fighting was still
going on in the neighbourhood, and a few gunshots were heard in the
distance; but, as our course led us away from the scene of action,
the result, if any, was never known to us.</p>

<p>In the afternoon our track bore more westward than before,
keeping about due NW. in general direction. We soon left the
fertile ground behind us, and for many miles rode over slightly
undulating stony downs, where the prevailing slope is always to the
N. or NW. The vegetation in these barren tracts is mostly of the
social kind, two or three species, or sometimes one only,
prevailing over a wide area, and then being suddenly supplanted
by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span> others.
<i>Artemisia Herba-alba</i>, and <i>Retama monosperma</i>, are in
this part of the country the dominant species. The monotony of the
way was pleasantly broken by crossing a little valley traversed by
a mere rivulet, which, however, sufficed to support a more varied
and cheerful vegetation. From the rising ground beyond it, we
gained a view to the south, and saw at a distance of eight or ten
miles a massive pile of building crowning a low, thickly-planted
hill, with a large enclosed space occupying part of the slope. The
<i>kasbah</i> belonged to the Kaïd of Haha, and was on a scale
proportioned to the importance of the Governor of one of the
largest and richest provinces of the empire. We found additional
reason for regretting the ill-timed local war, which prevented us
from paying him a visit. Although guilty of frequent acts of
atrocious cruelty, he was said to receive strangers with the utmost
courtesy and hospitality.</p>

<p>As evening was fast approaching, we rode hurriedly through a
little defile among the hills, where the rocks promised plants of
interest, and soon after came upon the first Argan trees that we
had seen since we quitted the province of Shedma, on April 30.
Associated as the tree was in our minds with Mogador, where we had
bidden farewell to European life, the sight awakened feelings of
regret at the approaching termination of our tour, tempered by
satisfaction at the prospect of returning to the usages and
intercourse of civilised life.</p>

<p>About seven o’clock we reached Mskala, a rather large village on
a stony slope, and saw close beside it an extensive camp where the
old Governor of Shedma, with a considerable force, was, by the
Sultan’s order, watching the progress of events in the contest
between the adjoining provinces. We established ourselves in a
stony field a few hundred yards away from the Governor’s camp, and
before long an ample <i>mona</i>, consisting of two sheep,
twenty-four fowls, tea, sugar, butter, and other luxuries, followed
a little later by seven large dishes of cooked food,
satisfied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[310]</span> the
cravings of our ever greedy soldiers, and the greater part of the
night was devoted to general feasting throughout our camp.</p>

<p>On the morning of May 31 our men were in no haste to bestir
themselves after the orgy of the preceding night, and we indulged
in a longer rest than usual. The weather was fine and clear, but
remarkably cool considering the moderate elevation of this
district. By our observations our camp stood at 1,562 feet (476·3
m.) above the sea; yet at 8 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>, when the
sun was already high above the horizon, the thermometer marked only
65° F. It was suggested that politeness required a visit to the old
Governor, and Hooker, with our interpreter and some of the escort,
devoted himself to that duty, while Ball set off alone for a short
botanical ramble over the bare, stony hills surrounding our camp.
The excursion was not very fruitful, except in the way of
illustrating the effects of barren soil and exposure, without the
slightest shade or cover, on the growth of many species that here
assumed a dwarfed and stunted condition.</p>

<p>Hooker, who had seen too much of the people of barbarous
countries to be open to the illusions that many travellers, new to
their manners, readily fall into, was, for once, very favourably
impressed by his interview with the Governor of Shedma. He had
found an old man of venerable aspect, with remarkably fine
features, whose conversation displayed a happy union of dignity and
frankness. He was engaged in superintending the distribution of pay
to his soldiers, and the subject that naturally arose for
discussion was the part which he and his forces were destined to
play in the intestine troubles of their neighbours. His
instructions from the Sultan were, as it seemed, of an indefinite
kind. He had, in the first instance, endeavoured to play the part
of mediator and avert the outbreak of hostilities. His present duty
was to hold himself in readiness to carry out such further orders
as he might receive. Considering the jealousies that<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span> always exist between the
people of neighbouring provinces, usually inhabited by tribes of
different race and origin, it may be doubted whether the troubles
and losses of their neighbours are in Marocco viewed as matters of
deep concern; or whether, as sometimes happens among the statesmen
of more important countries, the mediator may not feel some secret
satisfaction at the failure of his own proposals.</p>

<p>Shortly before 10 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> we started for
an easy ride of three hours over the undulating country that lies
between Mskala and the <i>kasbah</i> of Shedma, where we were to
meet Mr. Carstensen. It was an agreeable change from the bare
hills, with which we had of late been familiar, to enter on a
comparatively well-wooded country. The Argan trees were nowhere so
near together as to form what could be called a forest, but
scattered in small clumps or single trees over the surface, so that
nothing but a carpet of green turf was wanting to complete the
resemblance to an English park. On reaching the <i>kasbah</i>, we
found that our arrival was already expected. Our former host, the
Governor’s corpulent son, had two rooms within the castle walls
prepared for our reception, and before one o’clock we were
installed in clean quarters, with iron bedsteads of European make,
and cushions covered with Rabat carpets to complete the furniture.
Soon after two o’clock notice of Mr. Carstensen’s approach reached
the castle; the Governor’s son, with several armed men, went forth
to meet him, and before long we had the pleasure of again greeting
a gentleman to whose activity and thoughtful care we felt so much
indebted.</p>

<p>Much of the afternoon was naturally employed in giving an
account of our doings. When we reached the close of the story, and
Hooker spoke of his morning’s interview with the aged Governor, in
whose stronghold we were lodged, and the favourable impression made
by his appearance and demeanour, the reply was somewhat startling
even to men who had learned something of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_312">[312]</span> manners of the country. ‘Yes,’ said Mr.
Carstensen, ‘he is a fine-looking fellow, but he is not much better
than other men of his class. Last year he poisoned two friends of
mine under very discreditable circumstances.’ The victims were men
of consequence, near kinsmen of the Governor, and supposed to have
much influence among the Shedma people who resided in Mogador.
Early in the preceding year they were induced by hospitable
messages to pay a visit to their powerful relative. Familiar with
the ways of Marocco, and feeling sure that his friends were objects
of jealousy and suspicion to the great man, Mr. Carstensen at once
wrote an urgent letter, in which he expressed his strong anxiety
for the safety of the visitors. He soon received a reply written in
the most reassuring terms: ‘Far be it from me,’ wrote the Governor,
‘to harm these men; I shall take every care of them, and cherish
them as if they were my own children.’ A few weeks later another
letter reached Mogador: ‘Nothing could exceed the Governor’s grief
at having to announce that one of his guests had been taken
suddenly ill, and soon after died. Such, however, was the decree of
Allah, and we must all be resigned to his will.’ Mr. Carstensen was
not surprised when, a little later, another letter reached him,
conveying in nearly the same terms an account of the death of the
second guest. He had no doubt of foul play having been used; but
some months later received further assurance, when, on taxing the
Governor’s son (our fat friend) with his suspicions, the latter
answered: ‘Well, the fact is that my papa did not know what to do
with them, so he had them poisoned.’</p>

<p>It seems strange at the present day to find so near to Europe a
condition of society in some respects so like that of Italy in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, wherein no deed of atrocity
committed by men in authority awakens the slightest feeling of
moral reprobation. In the present instance local ideas had so far
prevailed that Mr. Carstensen did not consider it expedient to
allow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[313]</span> what had
occurred to interrupt his amicable relations with the Governor.</p>

<p>To lessen our regret for having failed to see something of the
western extremity of the Great Atlas, Mr. Carstensen proposed that
we should visit the Djebel Hadid, or Iron Mountain, a range of
hills, about 2,000 feet in height, that approaches the sea about
fourteen miles NE. of Mogador, and extends inland in a NE.
direction for a distance of some five-and-twenty miles. So far as
we knew, this had not been visited by any European naturalist
except M. Balansa, and we willingly accepted the suggestion, and,
following Mr. Carstensen’s advice, arranged to fix our camp next
day at Aïn el Hadjar, a spot where some copious springs burst forth
at the SW. extremity of the range.</p>

<p>The forenoon of June 1 was spent in the <i>kasbah</i>, and in a
short ramble on the adjoining slopes. The appearance of the country
was much altered since we had passed here at the end of April. The
spring vegetation was then far advanced, and many annuals had
ripened their seeds; but, thanks to the rain which had fallen at
intervals during May, a new crop of young plants had sprung up; and
during this and the following days we were able to gather several
species in flower that we had before seen only in fruit. The fields
where, at our last visit, the corn was being cut, had been ploughed
up, and pumpkins had been extensively sown round the <i>kasbah</i>.
There was more appearance of a taste for ornamental plants than we
had seen anywhere among the Moors. The Governor had transactions
with many of the foreign merchants at Mogador, and in that way had
no difficulty in obtaining seeds or cuttings of many garden
flowers. Amongst these we noted roses, pinks, garden-stock,
geraniums, dahlias, <i>Tagetes</i>, and <i>Coreopsis</i>. Oranges
and bananas were also cultivated; but it seemed doubtful whether in
ordinary seasons the climate is suitable. The spring rains had
recently extended over a wide tract of country, but
they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> seem to be
more often limited to the zone surrounding the higher
mountains.</p>

<p>Among other articles intended for presents, Ball had picked up
in London a large Highland brooch, with a yellow cairngorm crystal
set in silver. This, with an opera-glass, was given to the
Governor’s son as we took leave of him. The use of gold or silver
and jewels for personal adornment is forbidden by law or custom to
Moorish men; and the gift, which was sure to be transferred to a
favourite wife, did not seem to be much appreciated.</p>

<p>About mid-day we started for our short day’s ride, forming, with
Mr. Carstensen and his suite, a numerous cavalcade. Our course lay
about WNW., over low undulating hills, dotted with Argan trees.
Most of the surface was under cultivation, and appeared to be
moderately fertile. At 2.30 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> we
reached an olive grove near to a <i>zaouia</i> or sanctuary, called
El Masaats. Close to this was a dwelling, on a larger scale than is
common in this country, belonging to a man of some substance, with
whom Mr. Carstensen had friendly relations. It would have been
impossible to pass his home without a visit, and equally
impossible, according to local ideas, for him to neglect the rites
of hospitality. Luncheon for the entire party was speedily
provided, and, while assisting as spectators at the lively
conversation, we once more had to admire Mr. Carstensen’s perfect
command of the native dialect.</p>

<p>As we sat under the trees several parties of natives, dressed in
their best, passed by on their way to the adjoining <i>zaouia</i>.
This was the anniversary of the death of the local saint buried at
the sanctuary; and on such occasions the people of this country,
whether Moor or Shelluh, do not fail to resort to the sacred spot.
For the great majority the occasion seems to be no more than a
welcome opportunity for breaking the monotony of their daily life.
Excepting our Mogador Kaïd, who was most exact in the performance
of his devotions, we saw little<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_315">[315]</span> indication throughout our journey of
regular compliance with the injunctions for daily prayer, so
strictly observed in most Mohammedan countries.</p>

<p>After resuming our route we soon found evidence that we were
entering upon a new botanical region—that of the Atlantic coast.
Besides numerous species not seen since we had left Mogador at the
end of April, we here found for the first time several conspicuous
plants characteristic of this region. In hedges, and among bushes,
a tall <i>Bupleurum</i> (<i>B. canescens</i> of Schousboe) grew to
a height of eight or ten feet, and in similar situations
<i>Periploca lævigata</i> was just forming its fruit.</p>

<p>The facts known as to the distribution of the last-named plant,
and the allied species, <i>Periploca græca</i>, suggest
speculations as to their past history that deserve some passing
notice. The genus <i>Periploca</i>, which takes its name from the
twining stems of the species first known to botanists, has its
centre in the sub-tropical zone of the Asiatic continent. The
single mainly western species is <i>Periploca lævigata</i>. This
appears to be common in the Canary Islands, and grows freely in the
tract now visited by us to the north-west of Mogador. It has been
found in abundance on some rocky islands near the coast ot Sicily;
but, in spite of the silky hairs attached to the seeds, it has not
spread itself to neighbouring islands, nor to the Sicilian coast.
It has been detected in two or three places in the south-east of
Spain, and here and there in rocky places on the skirts of the
desert in the interior of Algeria and Tunis. Finally, it was long
ago found by Labillardière in one place on the coast of Syria. All
this points to the former wide diffusion of a plant which no longer
finds favourable conditions of existence, unless, perhaps, in the
Canary Islands. Its presence in the interior of North Africa may
possibly date from the period when it grew near the coast of a
great gulf opening to the Atlantic; but it is not easy to
understand how it has held its ground in a climate so different
from that of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[316]</span>
natural home. This plant has inherited from a remote ancestor a
habit which is now of no service to it. The young branches near the
root twine round any adjacent support; but as they grow older they
become stiff and straight, and the taller specimens derive no
adventitious support from this source.</p>

<p>The history of <i>Periploca græca</i>, the only species known to
the older botanists, is somewhat different. It is rather common in
Georgia, and in parts of Persia and Asia Minor. Less common in
Greece, it becomes extremely rare to the west of that limit, being
found only in Montenegro, at one place in Dalmatia, at another in
South-eastern Italy near Otranto, and, finally, in the pine-woods
on the Tuscan coast near Pisa. These facts indicate the former
wider extension of the species towards the west, and its gradual
retreat towards its primitive home in Asia. But we have more direct
evidence to that effect. The prints of leaves unmistakably
belonging to this species are not uncommon in the quaternary
deposits of the valley of the Arno. It may probably have flourished
in thickets on the Monte Pisano, and on the Monte Nero near
Leghorn, when these were islands in a tertiary sea, and gradually
descended towards the Mediterranean as the coast line was advanced
by a change of level, and by the formation of the deltas of the
Arno and the Serchio.</p>

<p>Another conspicuous plant, now seen for the first time, was
<i>Odontospermum odorum</i> (<i>Asteriscus</i> of De Candolle),
forming a dense dwarf bush, about two feet high. The whole plant
gives out an agreeable scent; but, except in this respect, and in
having the leaves covered with white silky hairs, it differs very
little from <i>0. graveolens</i>, a characteristic species of the
desert region, remarkable for its offensive smell. The
sweet-smelling species had been hitherto found only in the Mogador
district, and in the Canary Islands; but it was afterwards gathered
by us near Saffi.</p>

<p>We reached our destination at about 5.30 <span class=
"sc2">P.M.</span>, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_317">[317]</span> were agreeably surprised at the verdure and
freshness of the spot. Our camp was pitched among large olive
trees, near to the stream flowing from the principal spring. The
position somewhat resembles that of the so-called fountain of Elias
near Jericho, well known to travellers in Palestine; but the
contrast offered by the vegetation was remarkable. If a few plants
close to the stream appear to thrive about the waters of Elias, the
surrounding vegetation is meagre, and amid the straggling bushes of
exotic aspect that surround the spot the traveller seeks in vain
for effectual protection from the sun. Here, besides the gigantic
olive trees that must have been planted at a remote period, the
white poplar grows to a great size, and wild herbaceous plants were
still green, many of them in flower as well as fruit, at this
advanced season. At a time when the summer heat has become
intolerable at most places in North Africa the thermometer in our
tents stood at about 70° F. an hour before sunset, and the nights
were even cooler than some might have wished. Something was no
doubt due to the unusual amount of rain that had fallen during the
month of May; but if the climate of the coast region of South
Marocco were altered so as to resemble that of other places in the
same latitude, much of the existing vegetation would soon
disappear. On dry sandy slopes above our camp the effects of the
late rains were plainly seen, and before nightfall we collected a
considerable number of annual species in flower, sprung from seeds
borne by the first crop, and ripened two or three months
before.</p>

<p>We did not visit the remains of ancient miners’ work that are
visible at several places about the base of the hill; but we found
scoriæ in abundance, and some fragments of the ironstone from which
the mountain takes its name. It is not easy to conjecture the date
at which these iron mines can have been worked. There is no reason
to believe that any Moorish ruler ever attempted to turn them to
account; and although the Portuguese once<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_318">[318]</span> built a small fort near Mogador, it does
not seem probable that they ever held control over the adjoining
country. As to the long interval between the establishment of Roman
power in North Marocco and the disappearance of Roman civilisation
after the Saracen conquest history is silent, and it would be as
unsafe to assert as to deny that the workings of Djebel Hadid are
to be referred to that epoch. The only apparent alternative is to
attribute them to a still more remote period, when Carthaginian
colonies flourished on the coast.</p>

<p>In connection with this subject it is curious to remark that Leo
Africanus, in his account of the hilly range of the Djebel Hadid,
makes no allusion to the working of the mines there, although his
work contains frequent reference to the extraction of metals, not
excepting iron, from mines in the Great Atlas. In his day the
Djebel Hadid seems to have had a rather numerous population of
Bereber stock. He describes them as of gentle and inoffensive
manners, who expelled from among them men guilty of robbery and
violence. They had been much molested by the Arabs of the
neighbouring plains, and had agreed to purchase tranquillity by the
payment of black mail in the form of tribute, when the reigning
Sultan, whose policy it was to protect and favour the Bereber
population, despatched a military force (which Leo Africanus
himself accompanied), brought the Arabs to order, and relieved the
Berebers from tribute. At the present day the Shelluh stock has
apparently disappeared from this part of the country, being either
driven away, or absorbed by inter-marriage into the surrounding
Arab population.</p>

<p>A young man, the son of one of the wealthiest Jews in Mogador,
had been invited by Mr. Carstensen to accompany him in this
excursion. He was absolutely ignorant of the country beyond what he
may have learned in a daily canter over the sands at Mogador, and
was far less fitted for rough life than the majority of English
young ladies of the upper class. Everything in tent life seemed to
him strange<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> and
rather terrible. In the course of conversation over the evening
cigar it came out that he had never seen a scorpion; whereupon, by
order from Mr. Carstensen, a corner of the carpet within the tent
was turned up, and a scorpion-hole speedily found. When the ugly
creature was dug out of his hole and produced to the company, the
genuine consternation and disgust of our young friend were
irresistibly ludicrous. We afterwards heard that he passed a
miserable night, in constant terror of encountering the enemy, and
on the next day returned to the paternal home, whence he will not
again be easily lured.</p>

<p>The natives show no especial dislike for reptiles, excepting
poisonous snakes, which, in spite of reports to the contrary, must
be rare. We heard so much of them, and especially of the
<i>Cerastes</i> (<i>El Efah</i> of the Moors)—popularly called the
‘two minutes’ snake,’ because a person bitten is supposed to
survive so long—that at first we always carried about us a bottle
of liquid ammonia, as the best, though very uncertain, antidote.
But when we failed to see a single specimen, and were assured that
they are found only on the coast, we gradually laid all precautions
aside, and thought no more of serpents than we should have done in
Europe.</p>

<p>About this time we discovered that one of our escort had a
decided taste for reptiles, which we might have turned to account,
if we had known of it, by getting him to collect specimens. He was
a tall, lanky man, with a prominent nose, whom we had nicknamed,
from his peculiar personal appearance, ‘Don Quixote,’ but whose
real name was Sherrif Mouley Mohammed. He had captured several
toads and lizards, which he carried about with him, and showed
another trait of originality in being the only one of our native
followers who willingly drank coffee.</p>

<p>The morning of June 2 was brilliantly fine, and the sun remained
unclouded throughout the day, although the heat was at no time
oppressive. At 9.30 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> we started for
the ascent of the Djebel Hadid, directing our course
towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> a hollow in
the face of the hill, for the most part thickly clothed with
bushes, but showing here and there outcropping escarpments of rock
that promised a more varied vegetation than the otherwise uniform
stony slopes. We at once found that, in comparison with the outer
slopes of the Atlas, we had entered into a region botanically new
to us. The evergreen oak had disappeared, and the Arbutus, though
seen near Aïn el Hadjar, was evidently rare. The <i>Callitris</i>,
which is abundant near the base of the hill, does not ascend on its
flanks, and <i>Juniperus phœnicea</i> was either altogether absent
or very rare. In the place of all these there was an extraordinary
abundance and variety of spiny bushes, such as made the day’s
excursion severely remembered by the destruction of our garments
and the multitude of pricks and scratches with which our bodies
were covered. <i>Rhus oxyacantha</i> and <i>R. pentaphylla</i>,
<i>Celastrus senegalensis</i> and the wild olive, with <i>Genista
ferox</i> and <i>G. tridens</i>, were our chief tormentors, all,
except the olive, characteristic North African species, though two
or three of them have been detected in Southern Spain or in Sicily.
Leaving our horses to be led up the slope, we had hot work in
climbing the hill under a sun only a few degrees from the zenith,
contending the while with the various thorns and hooks and prickles
that molested us on every side. Every forward movement would be
resisted by a dozen spines running deep into our legs or arms, and
each attempt to draw back by the strong hooks with which some part
of our dress was sure to be held fast. When we reached the top of
the acclivity we found ourselves on the verge of a very extensive
plateau, in some parts nearly dead level, in others undulating, and
rising into knolls of tolerably uniform height. Before long we
reached a point commanding a wide view over the country on the
north side of the range of hills. The slopes below us appeared to
be under cultivation, and suggested the presence of a numerous
population; but the distant plain of Akermout, lying somewhat east
of due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[321]</span> north, did
not to our eyes afford any sign of cultivation. Jackson gives a
view<a id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> of the Djebel Hadid as seen from the plain of
Akermout, with a ruined town in the foreground, which he declares
to have been utterly destroyed by the plague about the middle of
the last century. The ruins, which have been seen by other
travellers, being about 30 miles distant from Mogador and fully 15
from the point where we stood, were naturally not perceived by
us.</p>

<p>Along the range of these hills are many saints’ tombs, usually
standing on some prominent point above the general level of the
plateau. One of these was on a slight eminence somewhat higher than
that first reached by us. Our escort, on this occasion limited to
three soldiers, displayed great anxiety lest we should attempt to
enter the <i>zaouia</i>, doubtless believing that our presence
would profane the sanctity of the spot.</p>

<p>We strained our eyes to make out as much as possible of the
Great Atlas range from the vantage ground we had now attained; but
the air was hazy towards the southern horizon. A faint outline was,
indeed, distinctly traceable, and was sketched by Ball, but no
details of any kind could be distinguished.</p>

<p>We estimated the height of the hilly range, where we ascended
it, at about 1,500 feet above our camp at Aïn el Hadjar, which we
had found to be 504 feet above the sea-level. It is not likely that
any part of the Djebel Hadid much exceeds the limit of 2,000 feet
above the sea, but, in a range fully 25 miles in length, it is not
possible to compare altitudes accurately by the eye.</p>

<p>The <i>Cistus</i> tribe was the chief ornament of the vegetation
here; and it was interesting to observe that the species were to a
great extent different from those that<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_322">[322]</span> abound in the inland districts and on the
lower slopes of the Atlas. <i>Cistus salviæfolius</i> and <i>C.
polymorphus</i>, both variable species, are common to this and the
Atlas, although, strange to say, the latter widely-spread
Mediterranean species has not been found in North Marocco.
<i>Helianthemum virgatum</i>, hitherto seen everywhere on dry stony
ground, was here wanting, as were <i>H. niloticum</i> and the less
common <i>H. glaucum</i> and <i>H. rubellum</i>. In their places
the top of the hill was in some places quite covered by large
bushes of <i>H. halimifolium</i> and <i>H. lavandulæfolium</i>,
both laden with masses of bright yellow flowers. On the slopes we
also found <i>H. canariense</i>, one of the very few species, not
strictly confined to the coast, that are exclusively limited to the
Canary Islands and South Marocco. Another rare species of the same
genus, now first seen by us, was <i>H. Lippii</i>. This seems to
have been originally a desert plant, the sole representative of the
genus in the arid regions of Beloochistan, South Persia, and the
Arabian desert, whence it has spread westward through Egypt to the
skirts of the Sahara. Beyond its natural home, it has been found
here and there, but rarely in Syria, Asia Minor, Sicily, and
South-western Marocco, and may not improbably be detected in
South-eastern Spain.</p>

<p>Growing among the bushes on the upper part of the hill we found,
in some abundance, the wild spiny form of the cultivated artichoke;
whether truly indigenous, or carried hither by former inhabitants,
it was impossible to decide.</p>

<p>On returning to our camp, some time before sunset, we found that
Mr. Carstensen had received letters from Europe that bore
intelligence of the terrible scenes enacted in Paris during the
last days of the Commune and the final suppression of the
insurrection. As was but natural, this completely engrossed our
thoughts and our conversation during the evening. It was depressing
to think that in the midst of the so-called advanced
civilisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[323]</span> of
Europe, to which we were now returning, ferocious passions,
surpassing in their destructiveness those of the barbarian or the
mere savage, may lie concealed until some unexpected shock causes
their explosion.</p>

<p>The night was even cooler than the preceding one, and to our
surprise the thermometer, about a quarter of an hour after sunrise
on June 3, marked only 56° F. We employed a couple of hours in the
morning in rambling about the gardens and irrigated ground near the
springs, without adding much of interest to our collections, and at
about 8 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> started for Mogador.</p>

<p>For some distance the country was well wooded. Orchards and
olive groves did not extend much beyond the bounds of the irrigated
tract; the <i>Callitris</i> then became predominant, intermixed,
here and there, with scattered Argan trees. In open spots the two
showy species of <i>Helianthemum</i> seen the day before, <i>H.
halimifolium</i> and <i>H. lavandulæfolium</i>, were still in full
flower, and we gathered, for the first time, a charming little
<i>Eryngium</i> (<i>E. tenue</i>) with extremely delicate spiny
leaves and involucre. Mediterranean shrubs, such as the
<i>Arbutus</i> and <i>Phillyrea</i>, growing along with such local
forms as <i>Rhus oxyacantha</i>, <i>Statice mucronata</i>, and
<i>Bupleurum canescens</i>, would have sufficiently informed a
botanist that he was approaching the Atlantic coast of North
Africa.</p>

<p>We soon after crossed a belt of land showing marks of former
cultivation, where no dwellings were in sight, but where we passed
close to a considerable group of earthy mounds, partly overgrown by
vegetation, and showing here and there the remains of massive walls
of <i>tapia</i> that had partially resisted the process of
destruction. These ruins marked the site of the large <i>kasbah</i>
of a former Governor. According to the custom of the country this
had been pillaged and destroyed some thirty years before, when the
owner fell from power. The traces of man’s former presence were
speedily lost as we entered on a tract of rocky ground, where the
tertiary calcareous rock lay in horizontal<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_324">[324]</span> beds, slightly excavated in places by
watercourses, and cut into irregular steps. The increasing
prevalence of blown sand now gave warning of a nearer approach to
the shore; the distant roar of the ceaseless Atlantic breakers fell
distinctly on the ear; amid the increasing masses of sand
vegetation became more and more sparse; we rode on amidst
undulating dunes of sand until, at length, on reaching the summit
of one of the ridges, the blue Atlantic lay before us.</p>

<p>With mingled feelings we cast our eyes on the waters that were
so soon to carry us back within the accustomed round of civilised
existence. If the prospect before us were in many ways most
welcome, there was yet some inevitable regret at the termination of
a journey so full of interest, and, in spite of trifling drawbacks,
so full of enjoyment. We felt that the time at our disposal had
been too limited, and that what we had accomplished in the way of
exploration fell far short of what we had expected; but enough had
been done to reward us amply for the labour expended, and we
indulged, as almost all genuine travellers are wont to do, in the
hope of returning again to the country we were now about to
leave.</p>

<p>We had reached the shore at a point about five miles north of
Mogador, which, however, was concealed from view by the lofty sand
dunes that have accumulated on the reef of rocks that stretches out
seaward on the north side of the town. For more than half the
distance we rode along the flat beach, where the sand gave somewhat
firmer footing than it did above high water mark. Our soldiers took
the opportunity for celebrating the prosperous termination of our
journey by an exhibition of ‘powder-play,’ for which the ground was
admirably adapted. Starting together, but not attempting to keep
line, they urge their horses to their fastest gallop; while at full
speed they discharge their long guns at an imaginary foe, fling the
gun up in the air, and catch it again; and finally the horse
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[325]</span> stopped short,
and thrown upon his haunches, by the sudden pressure of the severe
bit used in this country.</p>

<p>To avoid a long detour our course to Mogador lay over the high
sand dunes that encompass the town on the land side. The forms into
which the sand is fashioned by the wind here attracted our
attention. In many places the appearances were exactly those that
are found in the higher region of the Alps immediately after a fall
of fresh snow, and in truth the phenomena are nearly identical. At
a temperature considerably below freezing point snow commonly falls
in the condition of fine grains that do not cohere when they meet,
and, in a mechanical sense, differ from those of sand only by being
lighter. Our observations on the relation between the form of the
larger ridges and the smaller ripple marks, and the direction of
the wind, quite agree with those published by Maw.<a id=
"FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>When at length we escaped from the maze of ridges and hollows,
and stood upon the brow of the last sandy eminence, rather before 2
<span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, we found ourselves unexpectedly near
to our journey’s end. The town of Mogador, backed by the island,
with a few small coasting vessels lying in the channel between
them, presented to our unaccustomed eyes an almost imposing aspect.
As usual, one of the soldiers had ridden ahead to announce our
approach; and when, after passing by the Christian burial-ground,
we drew near to the walls, crowds of people came out to meet us,
and to gaze upon the strangers, of whose adventures in the Great
Atlas fanciful reports had gone abroad. At the gate several mounted
soldiers, sent by the Governor as a guard of honour, joined the
procession; and thus heralded, with all due state, we made our
solemn entry into Mogador, and, along with our kind host, rode
directly to the British Consulate.</p>

think that the river Lixus of Hanno is the Sous. The description,

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">However</span> pleasant were our
recollections of the rough life we had been leading for the past
five weeks, we could not fail to appreciate the physical comfort
involved in a return to the habits of civilised life at Mogador. A
chair to sit upon, a table at which to eat one’s meals, a hundred
other things to which daily use makes us quite insensible and
indifferent, become luxuries to one who has for some time been
deprived of them.</p>

<p>We had no lack of occupation during the four days of our stay at
Mogador. The large harvest of dried plants collected during our
journey had to be put in order and safely packed for conveyance to
England. It had been our prime object to obtain as far as possible
a complete representation of the Flora of the territory which we
had been able to explore; and for that purpose we had made it a
point to carry away a specimen, or at least a fragment, of every
species, even the commonest, from each district that we traversed.
In this way our collections represent, not merely the constituents
of the South Marocco flora, but, to a great extent, the
distribution of the several species. Besides attending to this, our
main object, we did not fail to collect duplicates of most of the
new and rare species seen during our journey for distribution to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[327]</span> chief public
herbaria, and to the botanists who have illustrated the flora of
the Mediterranean region. To avoid chances of future error, it was
necessary to give much care to the labelling and packing of our
collections, which we could not expect to see again until some time
after our return to England. Fortunately our specimens were nearly
all quite dry, and in excellent condition; and we had not to
complain of the moist condition of the air which had given us so
much trouble during our first stay on the coast. The cool breezes
from the N. and NE., which make the climate of this region so
agreeable and healthful in summer, now steadily prevailed. The air
at this season is relatively dry and free from haze, and, as a
consequence, the daily range of the thermometer is greater than at
any other season. Yet, as compared with any other place we know,
the extremes are singularly moderate, and never exceed the limits
conducive to full health and enjoyment. The thermometer, observed
pretty frequently by night as well as by day, only twice rose
during our stay to 77° F. At about 3 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span>
it usually fell to 63° F., and on one occasion to 61°.</p>

<p>On our return we found awaiting us a small addition to our
Marocco herbarium. With the kind assistance of Mr. Carstensen, we
had arranged during our first visit that two natives, who had
received a first lesson in the art of drying plants, should start
for Agadir early in May, and should bring back whatever plants they
could then find in flower. The collection, which we now shared
between us, was not of much importance, including, as it did, but a
single species not found by us. We doubted, at the time whether the
men had, as they solemnly asserted, really reached the
neighbourhood of Agadir; but we have now reason to believe that the
vegetation of the coast region from Mogador southward to about the
twenty-ninth parallel of latitude is very uniform.</p>

<p>Since our return from Marocco our friend M. Cosson, with the
active assistance of the late M. Beaumier, has<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_328">[328]</span> succeeded in engaging the services of
two native collectors, one of them a very intelligent Jew, the
other a Shelluh mountaineer. From the former large collections from
the country as far south as the borders of Oued Noun, and as far
east as the oasis of Akka, have been sent to Paris; and the latter
has contributed a few additions to the flora of the Great Atlas,
along with many of the species collected by us. With his accustomed
liberality, M. Cosson has sent us duplicates of these fresh
contributions to the flora of Marocco.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of June 4, we went to pay a farewell visit to
the banks of the Oued Kseb, which had been the scene of our first
botanical excursion in South Marocco. During the interval of six
weeks a great change had passed over the vegetation; most of the
annuals were completely dried up and had disappeared; but the
excursion was not altogether unproductive, and we were able to add
a few plants to our collections.</p>

<p>There remained a point of some botanical interest, which it was
very desirable to clear up before our departure. The curious
cactoïd <i>Euphorbia</i>, producing the Gum Euphorbium,<a id=
"FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
written of by Dioscorides and Pliny, grows in the interior
provinces of South Marocco. The only modern writer who has given an
account of it is Jackson,<a id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who, though no botanist,
was a careful and conscientious observer. In his account of the
plant, and the accompanying plate, we had been struck by some
apparent discrepancies. The gum, as he says, is obtained from the
plant growing on the lower region of the Atlas; but the same plant
is, according to him, abundant about Agadir, and is carried thence
to Mogador for the use of the tanners. The Agadir plant, however,
he declares to produce no gum. Further than this, in the plate
annexed to his description, the left-hand figure, giving a view of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span> whole plant on
a reduced scale, shows the thick fleshy branches, with four angles,
as we had seen them in the specimen given to Hooker by the Kaïd at
Mesfioua; while the right-hand figure, showing a fragment of the
natural size, represents the end of a branch, with numerous (about
ten) projecting fleshy ribs, beset with spines. Hooker came to the
conclusion that there were possibly two quite distinct plants known
to Jackson, and on returning to Mogador he proceeded to make
inquiry on the subject.</p>

<p>Before long a native was brought to us who appeared to be well
acquainted with the Agadir plant, and who declared that it grows in
abundance about half-way between that place and Mogador. Upon this
Hooker became anxious to start at once for the purpose of
personally examining the suspected plant, and securing live
specimens for Kew. To this Mr. Carstensen felt it necessary to
object. Matters, as he informed us, had been getting from bad to
worse in the great province of Haha, which includes the whole
sea-board between Mogador and Agadir. Between the discontent caused
by repeated acts of unprovoked cruelty on the part of the Governor,
and the results of the war still proceeding between him and his
neighbours in Mtouga, the province had lapsed into a complete state
of anarchy, and a European attempting to travel at such a time
would be exposed to serious risk. It was reluctantly agreed by
Hooker that our native informant, with a companion, should depart
for the spot, which he professed to know, charged with the
commission to bring back a donkey-load of specimens of the living
plant.</p>

<p>June 5 was a day of some anxiety in Mogador, and the news which
we received at breakfast brought full confirmation of Mr.
Carstensen’s apprehensions as to the disturbed state of the
country. We had already noticed that the camel-drivers arriving
from Marocco, or other places in the interior, are used, after
discharging their goods in the town, to litter their camels outside
the wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span> at a place
close to the eastern gate. We now heard that during the preceding
night a party of marauders from Haha had pushed their audacity so
far as to attack and kill a camel-driver sleeping at the foot of
the city wall, and drive off seven camels that were in his charge.
Whether the guard at the gate close at hand slept soundly through
the scene, or had their own reasons for non-interference, we failed
to learn.</p>

<p>This was one of a series of incidents that was not completed
until after our return to England; but as we were so directly
concerned in the results of the disturbances in Haha, and as we
learned the particulars in an authentic way from Mr. Carstensen,
who had daily intercourse with eye-witnesses and actors in the
drama, it is as well here to give the story as we learned it.</p>

<p>The Governor of Haha, the largest and most important province in
the empire, which long maintained its independence of the Sultan,
had hereditary claims to the government of the twelve cognate
Shelluh tribes who make up the population. Although miserably
fallen away from its ancient prosperity—in the time of Leo
Africanus there were six or seven populous towns and several
fortified places, where there is now nothing better than a village—
the province still furnishes much agricultural produce and live
stock, and sends hides, grain, oil, and other merchandise for
exportation to the port of Mogador. The Governor, at the time of
our visit, had long held his office; by liberal contributions to
the Imperial treasury, he had kept himself in the favour of the
Sultan, while amassing for himself vast wealth; and, according to
the testimony of the French naturalist, M. Balansa, confirmed by
the consuls who had visited him, he showed an appreciation of the
advantages of civilised life, and a desire to maintain friendly
relations with Europeans.</p>

<p>Thus wealthy, powerful, and feared, this man might have
maintained his authority unbroken, but that by a continuous course
of oppression and cruelty he at length<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_331">[331]</span> stirred up the spirit of resistance amongst
his own people. Vengeance, however atrocious, for acts of revolt is
so fully an admitted right of men in authority in Marocco that it
did not seem to count for much in the indictment against him that
on one occasion he inflicted on several hundred—some said a
thousand—insurgent prisoners the horrible punishment of the
<em>‘leather glove.’</em> A lump of quicklime is placed in the
victim’s open palm, the hand is closed over it, and bound fast with
a piece of raw hide. The other hand is fastened with a chain behind
the back, while the bound fist is plunged into water. When, on the
ninth day, the wretched man has the remaining hand set free, it is
to find himself a mutilated object for life, unless mortification
has set in, and death relieves him from further suffering. But, in
addition to such acts as these, the Kaïd of Haha was accused of
capricious deeds of ferocity that revolted the consciences of his
people. Among other stories of the kind, we were told that on some
occasion when he was having a wall made round his garden, he
happened to see a young man jump over the low unfinished fence.
Feeling in some way annoyed at this, he had the unfortunate boy’s
right foot struck off, as a lesson not to repeat the
experiment.</p>

<p>In such a country, where the danger of revolt is so terrible,
the discontent among the people of Haha might long have slumbered,
but for the occasion given by the war with the neighbouring
province of Mtouga. The spirit of resistance spread rapidly, and it
soon become apparent that the position of the old Kaïd was becoming
untenable. At last he resolved upon flight, after previously
securing the aid and protection of his neighbour, the Governor of
Shedma. Departing at night, with a train of women and slaves, and
with twenty-two mules laden with treasure, he reached by daylight
the borders of Shedma, just in time to forestall pursuit from his
outraged subjects. He escaped unharmed—although a bullet intended
for him by the pursuers struck in the hand his protector, the
Governor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span>
Shedma—and continued his journey to the city of Marocco. On
reaching the capital, he at once placed himself under the
protection of the Viceroy,<a id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and judiciously sacrificed
half of his wealth as an offering to the imperial treasury. He was
received with favour; a handsome house was assigned to him as a
residence; and for anything we know to the contrary, he may be
still enjoying, what is seldom granted to a high functionary in
Marocco, a tranquil old age.</p>

<p>When the flight of the Governor was noised abroad in Haha, the
people of the country proceeded, according to custom, to pillage
and destroy the castle of their oppressor. Among other things
brought to light were two skeletons built into the wall of one of
the inner chambers. The Kaïd had two nephews, who were, or might
have become, dangerous rivals, and it was in this way that he had
disposed of them.</p>

<p>Among the stores found in the <i>kasbah</i> were several large
earthen jars of butter, and others of honey, and these furnished
forth a feast for the unbidden guests. The Kaïd was a thoughtful
man, and even in the hurry of his departure he had not forgotten
his disobedient subjects. The feast was not well over when the
effects began to be apparent, and a large number of those who
partook of it died in agony. The Kaïd had mixed a large quantity of
arsenic with the delicacies which he had been forced to leave
behind him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as we had seen, the relations between the people of
Mogador and their neighbours had become very unsatisfactory.
Indignant at the outrage committed before our departure, the
Governor of Mogador thought it necessary to show his strength and
enforce respect. He accordingly despatched 200 men, under the
command of our old friend Kaïd el Hadj, to demand satisfaction for
what had happened, and security for better conduct in the future.
The result was exactly what might have been<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_333">[333]</span> expected from the pious, but decidedly
unwarlike, character of the leader. The Haha people explained to El
Hadj that they were more than a match for him and his men, and that
his wisest course was to return by the shortest road to Mogador.
The mind of the commander was always open to prudent counsel, and
he professed himself convinced; and to save him and his men from
trouble by the way they were escorted to the gates of Mogador by
ten men from Haha.</p>

<p>Policy, however, soon effected what valour had failed to
achieve. A virtual blockade was established, and all communication
with Haha suspended. This may have been inconvenient to the Mogador
people; but, at the worst, they could always obtain supplies from
Shedma by the road which we had followed from Aïn el Hadjar. To the
Haha people it soon became intolerable. Mogador is their chief
market. There they sell their provisions, and it is the Mogador
merchants who purchase their oil and hides and other exports. An
envoy was sent to re-establish friendly relations, and to entreat
the foreign Consuls to mediate in their favour. In token of entire
submission, they proposed that 2,000 men from the province should
come to make a peace-offering. The Governor judiciously thought
that number excessive—there was no knowing what these wild hill
people might do, if they fancied themselves masters of the town—and
agreed to receive a deputation of 200 representatives of the Haha
tribes. On the appointed day they came, driving before them several
bullocks; and, on arriving before the Sultan’s palace, proceeded to
hamstring and slaughter them as a propitiatory offering to the
sovereign authority, whereupon friendly relations were at once
re-established.</p>

<p>While these events were undeveloped, the thoughts of the Mogador
people, European as well as native, were fully exercised, although
they felt secure from positive danger. A part of the day was
occupied by us in taking leave of our escort and attendants, and in
distributing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span> among
them presents and rewards, well earned by some, and which could not
be refused even to the less deserving. A great change had come over
the appearance of many of our men since their return. Ambak and
Hamed, who had made the journey on foot, with none but the
scantiest and the poorest clothing, now appeared fresh from the
bath and dressed in their best: Hamed looking especially dignified
in a snow-white turban, and formidable-looking dagger stuck in his
girdle. All seemed pleased and satisfied with the very moderate
sums awarded them—to which in the case of the more deserving were
added knives and other articles of English cutlery. The soldiers
who had travelled all the way from Mogador received eight dollars
(40 francs) each, while to the Marocco men were given five dollars
each.</p>

<p>When the rest were disposed of, there remained the two officers.
Towards Kaïd el Hadj, who had always maintained a friendly and
respectful bearing, we had none but kindly feelings. When, in
addition to the present of twelve dollars, Hooker handed him a
silver watch, a large sheath-knife, and a few smaller presents, the
old man was quite overcome; his eyes were filled with tears; and he
took leave of us with many pious wishes for our future welfare. As
regards El Hasbi the case was very different. He had from the very
day of our departure from Marocco done his utmost to defeat our
wishes and plans, and had not even the grace to veil his opposition
beneath a civil exterior. Hooker decided on writing a letter to El
Graoui, reporting our opinion of the conduct of his subordinate,
and sending this to the great man with a sum of ten dollars, to be
given to El Hasbi, or withheld, as he might decide.</p>

<p>The Haha troubles affected our pockets in an unexpected way. In
ordinary times there is a constant demand for baggage animals at
Mogador, and we were led to expect that we should sell at a profit
the mules that we had bought at Marocco. The usual price at Mogador
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span> from
8<em>l</em>. to 10<em>l</em>. for a serviceable beast. But in the
present state of the neighbouring country the roads were considered
unsafe, and traffic with the interior was almost completely
stopped. We were therefore considered rather fortunate in selling
our team of mules at about 5<em>l</em>. apiece.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we had a fresh illustration of native
manners that somewhat amused us, for we were no longer in the frame
of mind in which a slight abuse of authority could shock our
European ideas. The Mogador brass-workers have a high reputation
throughout Marocco, and during our first stay in the town we had
ordered a variety of articles from the man who was considered the
most skilful in his craft. The time fixed for delivering the goods
was fully a week before the actual date of our return. When Mr.
Carstensen heard that the order had not been executed at the
appointed time, he sent a message informing the Governor of the
fact; and the latter forthwith had the man thrown into prison, and
appointed a soldier to keep guard, and see that he did no other
work than that promised to us. After two or three days the prisoner
got some friend to intercede with Mr. Carstensen for his release,
and at the instance of the latter the Governor relented. To-day the
articles were all duly brought to the Consulate, and the maker
seemed well content with the very moderate payment agreed upon.</p>

<p>We should have gladly made our return voyage in the comfortable
steamer <i>Verité</i>, that had carried us from Tangier, but the
date of her arrival on her return from the Canary Islands to
Marseilles was uncertain. Meanwhile the <em>Lady Havelock</em>
steamer, plying between the Marocco coast and London, had reached
Mogador, and we resolved to take our passage by that conveyance to
Tangier.</p>

<p>Farewell visits and the packing of our collections occupied the
greater part of the day on June 6. At the wharf the port labourers
were busy in shipping large bales of esparto grass, which chiefly
comes from the adjoining province of Haha. This is now largely
consumed by paper-makers<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_336">[336]</span> in France and England. It is said that the
greater part of what reaches England from Marocco is used in the
paper-mills that supply the ‘Times’ newspaper.</p>

<p>A caravan had lately reached Mogador from the Soudan, and we saw
several bales of ostrich feathers lying on the wharf. They were
imperfectly covered with coarse sacking; and the outer layer of
feathers, soiled and broken, seemed to be quite worthless, although
the total value of such a bale must be very considerable. Some
trade routes in Central Asia and elsewhere in the world involve
terrible hardships to those engaged in the transport; but it seems
that there is none nearly so formidable as that from Timbuktou to
Marocco. In several directions the way across the Great Desert is
facilitated by the occurrence of oases at moderate intervals; as in
the way from Tafilelt to Touat, and in the line followed by the
Arab traders from Tripoli to Murzouk. But throughout the greater
part of the way from Timbuktou to Akka there appear to be no true
oases. Wells are few and far between, and the supply of water often
miserably scanty; and even when a caravan escapes all the dangers
of the long way, and the bones of men and camels are not left to
bleach upon the burning-sands, the sufferings of the travellers
must reach the verge of human endurance.<a id=
"FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
At the present day the regular caravans no longer attempt to reach
Marocco or Fez by way of Tafilelt, the routes over the Atlas being
too insecure. The bad reputation of the Oued Noun people is equally
effectual in closing the coast route from the south to Mogador; and
the course adopted is by the oasis of Akka, lying south of the
Anti-Atlas range, and about 100 miles east of Oued Noun. From Akka
to Agadir the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
rounds the western extremity of Anti-Atlas, through a hilly and
populous country, which appears to be safe enough for any but
Christian travellers.</p>

<p>Among other articles exported from Mogador is the brown gum
arabic of commerce, which comes chiefly from Demnet, and elsewhere
on the skirts of the Atlas east of Marocco. If native testimony is
to be credited, the <i>Acacia</i> producing this gum is not
different from that which we saw growing abundantly in Haha and
elsewhere through the hilly country,<a id=
"FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
though we did not hear of any gum being exported from the western
provinces. It seems unlikely that this plant, named by Willdenow
<i>Acacia gummifera</i>, should be the only one of a group of
allied species extending across Northern Africa that produces no
gum. We were interested in finding that the parcel shown to us,
sent for export from Mogador, was packed in the dry stems and
leaves of a <i>Ceratophyllum</i>, a genus of aquatic plants not
hitherto seen in Marocco.</p>

<p>During the afternoon the two natives who were despatched two
days before returned safely from Haha, driving before them a donkey
laden with the Agadir <i>Euphorbia</i>. Hooker’s suspicion was at
once verified. The plant of the coast region is quite different
from the gum-producing species of the inland region, but in
appearance it comes near the East Indian species, <i>E.
officinarum</i> of Linnæus. Under the name <i>E. Beaumieriana</i>,
the coast plant, which has yet not been collected in flower or
fruit, along with <i>E. resinifera</i> from Demnet, and another new
species brought by a native collector from the southern borders of
Sous, has been carefully described by our friend M. Cosson.</p>

<p>In the course of the evening we went by invitation to a Jewish
wedding, which was celebrated in the house of one of the chief
Israelite families in the town. The proceedings were quite in
accordance with the descriptions given by other travellers in
Marocco. The bride, who sat cross-legged, arrayed in gorgeous
attire, had regular features<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_338">[338]</span> and large dark eyes, but seemed dazed and
stupified by the crowd, the noise, the glare of many lights, and
the heat of the close rooms, from which we were not sorry soon to
escape.</p>

<p>On June 7 the time for our departure arrived, and towards sunset
we went on board the <em>Lady Havelock</em>, accompanied by our
kind host, Mr. Carstensen, and by the late Mr. Grace, the
representative of one of the chief English mercantile houses
engaged in the Marocco trade, to whom we were indebted for numerous
marks of attention during our stay in South Marocco.</p>

<p>We found in Captain Bone, who commanded the <em>Lady
Havelock</em>, an old acquaintance; for it was in this steamer
that, on our first arrival, we crossed the Straits from Gibraltar
to Tangier. He had warned us not to expect much good from Marocco
or the Moors, and was always well pleased when in the course of
conversation he was able to extract any facts to confirm his
unfavourable prepossessions.</p>

<p>The north wind had been blowing freshly all day, but, as usual,
it fell at nightfall. The moment for heaving the anchor had
arrived; we took leave of our Mogador friends, and soon found
ourselves once more gently rolling on the broad Atlantic waves.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 8 we were before Saffi. Mr. Hunot, the
British Vice-Consul, soon came on board, and we gladly accepted his
courteous invitation to spend the day ashore. Through his brother,
who had so kindly assisted us during our diplomatic struggle with
the authorities in the city of Marocco, Mr. Hunot already knew of
our journey in the interior, and kindly interested himself in
forwarding our wish to make the best use of our time at Saffi. This
place is considered to be much hotter in summer than Mogador; yet,
during an excursion of several hours, we found the heat much less
oppressive than it commonly is at the same season on the shores of
the Mediterranean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span>The form of the
land here at once dictated the best course to be taken by a party
of naturalists. On the north side a range of lofty, almost vertical
cliffs rises from the sea beach, and leaves no space for any but a
few marine plants. On the landward side of the town the hills show
gentle slopes, in great part under tillage, and bare of trees.
Along the shore southward the coastline is formed by reefs of
friable tertiary rock, rising from thirty to fifty feet above the
water’s edge, and forming a shelf of level land, in great part
overgrown with shrubs and small bushes. On the landward side the
hills rise at first with a gentle slope, and then more steeply,
until, about four miles from the town, they show a steep escarpment
of limestone rock, locally known as the Jews’ Cliff, and this was
fixed upon as the limit of our excursion.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunot, who had accompanied us, had kindly provided horses
for our use; but we found so many objects to interest us that the
greater part of the way was made on foot.</p>

<p>We had not gone far along the sea rocks when we found them
plentifully covered with a species of <i>Zygophyllum</i> altogether
new to us. Though evidently allied to the <i>Z. album</i>, so
common in Egypt and elsewhere in North Africa, this differed at
first sight in the much greater size of the thick succulent
branches and leaves. It turned out to be the <i>Z. Fontanesii</i>
of Webb, a plant hitherto known only in the Canary Islands. Another
characteristic plant of those islands was <i>Helianthemum
canariense</i>; but this had already been found by us near Aïn el
Hadjar.</p>

<p>When we reached the foot of the Jews’ Cliff, which rises some
300 feet above the shelf of land at its seaward base, we resolved
to divide our forces. From fragments already picked up, and from
Mr. Hunot’s information, we were led to think that some of the
exposed beds of limestone must abound in fossils. Hooker resolved
to make a search; and, with Mr. Hunot, ascended the face of the
cliff, which is easy enough of access, and ultimately
reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span> the top. He
was rewarded by getting good specimens of several fossils, the most
abundant being Echinoderms of a new type, since described by Mr.
Etheridge in the ‘Quarterly Journal of the Geological
Society.’<a id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Ball meanwhile was engaged in botanising on the sea rocks and
among the bushes at the foot of the cliff. In the former habitat he
found two species heretofore known only at Mogador, <i>Andryala
mogadorensis</i> and <i>Frankenia velutina</i>. Among the bushes
there were no plants of special interest, but he nevertheless had
an unexpected encounter. While searching about among the bushes a
rustling in the dry grass caught his ear; he looked down, and
there, within a yard of his feet, was <i>el efah</i>, the dreaded
‘two minutes’ snake,’ nearly as thick and about as long as a man’s
arm. As the enemy was retreating, gliding gently among the bushes,
there was no occasion to move, and he watched it for a few seconds
till it disappeared. The glistening scales were of many colours,
forming a sort of mosaic on a ground of pale brown, very much as
represented in the plate to Jackson’s ‘Account of Marocco.’ Even
supposing that the virulence of the poison in the bite of this
snake has not been exaggerated by popular report, it can scarcely
be thought formidable to strangers unless they happen to be
botanists. It keeps habitually to the cover afforded by the
numerous small bushes of the coast region, and its form is so ill
fitted for active motion that it can only strike a near object. The
only danger arises from the chance of inadvertently hurting it
while moving about in the places which it frequents.</p>

<p>About 4 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> we returned to dine at the
British Consulate. At Mr. Hunot’s table we met Mr. Jordan, the son
of a British merchant engaged in the Marocco trade. He had been
brought up in the country, spoke Moorish-Arabic familiarly, was
used to dress as a Moor, and had established<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_341">[341]</span> intimate relations with many of the
natives. Emboldened by custom, he had on one occasion joined a
party of Moorish merchants bound for Tarudant in Sous, and safely
reached that place. Something, however, either in his appearance,
or accent, or gesture excited suspicion; it was noised abroad that
a Christian was in the town, and an excited crowd soon gathered
round the house in which he and his companions were lodged. As the
demeanour of the people became more and more threatening, the
travellers barricaded the entrance, and prepared to defend
themselves by force. After some hours, as evening was coming on,
the assailants became more determined, and proceeded to pile up
faggots round the building with the obvious intention of burning
the house with its inmates. Just as matters were looking very
serious, the Governor of the town made his appearance with a party
of soldiers; the doors were opened, and the Governor said to Mr.
Jordan: ‘You have a horse, and you have from this till to-morrow
morning to put a wide space between you and Tarudant; you had
better lose no time.’ Protected by the soldiers, the Englishman
rode out of the city, and made his way towards Agadir by night,
thence returning safely to Mogador.</p>

<p>Tarudant was once a large and flourishing city, and its gardens
were famous throughout Marocco; but, like the rest of the country,
it has fallen off from its former condition, and is now a poor and
decaying place.</p>

<p>It is clear that in that part of the empire increasing religious
fanaticism has accompanied declining prosperity. In the sixteenth
century Tarudant was resorted to by English and French merchants,
and it was the seat of active trade, and of manufactures in copper
which was extracted from mines in the neighbouring chain of the
Great Atlas. The population was apparently then altogether of the
native Berber stock. In the course of the continued efforts made by
successive Sultans to establish their authority in the Sous
province, the Moorish element became more and more predominant in
the towns, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span> to
this we may reasonably attribute their subsequent decline.</p>

<p>When Leo Africanus travelled in Sous, early in the sixteenth
century, Tarudant was only one of many large and flourishing towns,
and was much surpassed in importance by Tagavost, a place whose
very name has disappeared from memory, and whose exact site is
unknown to modern geographers.</p>

<p>Mr. Hunot, who is well acquainted with the city of Marocco,
estimated the population at about 40,000, but admitted that there
were no materials for an accurate guess on the subject. Fully
one-fourth of the inhabitants had been carried off by the last
visitation of cholera, from which the coast towns, with the sole
exception of Mogador, had also suffered severely.</p>

<p>The main check to population in the greater part of the empire
arises, however, from the recurrence of famines. These sometimes
are caused by locusts, but are then of a partial and local
character; but those consequent on the occasional failure of the
winter and spring rains are not very unfrequent, and are of
terrible severity. Among the means resorted to at such times for
supporting life, we learned that the roots of a small plant of the
<i>Arum</i> tribe are much used. This, known to botanists as
<i>Arisarum vulgare</i>, is very common throughout North Africa, as
well as in many parts of the south of Europe. It flowers in this
country in winter, and the leaves wither and disappear in the
spring. The root, which is not so large as an ordinary walnut,
contains, as is usual in the Aroid tribe, an acrid juice, which
makes it quite uneatable in the natural state. This, however, is
easily removed by frequent washing of the pounded roots, and the
residue is innoxious and nutritive. The same process has been
applied with success to the common European plant, <i>Arum
maculatum</i>, as well as to many exotic species of the same
tribe.</p>

<p>Among the many difficulties that beset commercial intercourse
with Marocco, the frequent interruption of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_343">[343]</span> internal traffic arising from frequent
petty warfare between neighbouring tribes is not to be forgotten. A
merchant may purchase a quantity of produce at what appears a
remunerative price; but if he be unable to have it conveyed within
a convenient time to the port whence it is to be shipped, his
bargain may turn out a very bad one. At Mogador we had left things
in a condition foreboding a complete suspension of communication
with the interior; we now heard that owing to some local troubles
the coast road from Saffi to Mogador was temporarily closed.</p>

<p>At nightfall we returned to our steamer, but found that we were
to remain for the night in the roadstead of Saffi. On the next
morning our obliging host, Mr. Hunot, again came on board, and we
enjoyed his agreeable conversation until the time came for starting
on the short run to Mazagan. We reached that place in the afternoon
of June 9, and landed with Captain Bone at a wharf beside the
Castle built by the Portuguese. It was proposed that we should go
through the town, and visit the great cistern which was constructed
during the prolonged Portuguese occupation of this place, and which
enabled them to resist successfully the frequent sieges undertaken
by the Moors. We preferred, however, to make use of the short time
at our disposal in examining the vegetation near the shore on the
north side of the town.</p>

<p>The net result of our short excursion was not very large or
brilliant; but, in the case of a country so little known as
Marocco, the interest of his collections to a naturalist does not
mainly depend on the rarity or novelty of the objects he may happen
to meet. Each plant or animal carried away contributes an item of
information respecting the distribution of the organised world, the
value of which it is impossible at the time to estimate. Travellers
who happen to visit little-known countries would do well to
remember that, with the most trifling expenditure of trouble, they
may make useful contributions to natural science by preserving
specimens of even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[344]</span>
the most insignificant-looking objects, provided always that these
are afterwards placed in the hands of competent naturalists.<a id=
"FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>We returned on board about sunset, but did not leave the roads
of Mazagan till about 10 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span> When we came
on deck next morning, June 11, we were nearing the coast opposite
Casa Blanca, and cast anchor soon after 7 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> We here found the <em>Sydney Hall</em>, belonging
to the same owners as the <em>Lady Havelock</em>. She had left
London on June 2, reached Casa Blanca on the 10th, and soon after
our arrival started again on her outward voyage to Mogador and the
Canary Islands. We had the pleasure of again seeing Mr. Dupuis, the
active British Vice-Consul at Casa Blanca; but as our stay was to
be short, and we had already made an excursion ashore, we did not
now attempt to land.</p>

<p>During our return voyage our minds were once more exercised by
the peculiar climatal conditions of this portion of the African
coast. It did not appear that the cool temperature which had
prevailed since our return to the neighbourhood of Mogador on the
1st inst. was considered in any way remarkable or unusual, although
travellers who have visited the city of Marocco at this season
speak of a temperature of 90° F. in the shade as not uncommon; and
at Fez, though in the immediate vicinity of high mountains, still
higher temperatures have been recorded. The direction of the wind
on the coast in summer, which to the south of Cape Cautin is
constantly between the north and north-east, is less uniform to the
north of that limit; but the prevailing sign is NE., and this no
doubt is the most important factor in determining the climate.</p>

<p>There is, however, another element that cannot be<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_345">[345]</span> overlooked. When we examine
the chart exhibiting the oceanic currents in the North Atlantic,
compiled at our Meteorological Office, and fix our attention on the
portion lying between the 30th and 40th degrees of latitude, and
extending from the coasts of Portugal and Marocco to 20° of west
longitude, we find that the currents throughout this large area
constantly move in a direction between SE. and SSE., with an
average velocity which increases from about five miles per day in
the longitude of Madeira, to at least ten miles as we approach
within 100 miles of the shores of Europe and Africa. This velocity
again diminishes with a nearer approach to land; and, from a few
observations, it would seem that along the Marocco coast the
current is deflected in a SW. direction, parallel to that of the
coast line.</p>

<p>It is clear that in this continual flow of cool water from the
north-west we have a cause which cannot fail to produce its effect
on the climate of the adjoining coasts. It would be a matter of
interest to ascertain how far the direction and velocity of the
ocean currents are modified by the prevailing winds, which here set
in nearly opposite directions in winter and in summer; but an
answer to such an inquiry will require much time, and the
accumulation of a large number of careful observations.</p>

<p>We completed our cargo by taking on board at Casa Blanca
considerable quantities of maize, beans, oil, goat-skins and wool;
and our captain resolved not to touch at Rabat, but to run direct
to Tangier. Eighteen hours under steam carried us past Cape
Spartel, and in the afternoon of June 12 we lay off Tangier.</p>

<p>Hooker’s numerous and pressing engagements in England made him
resolve to forego the pleasure of revisiting the neighbourhood of
Tangier, and comparing the summer vegetation with that which we had
admired two months before; he therefore determined to reach
Gibraltar as soon as possible, with the hope of there catching the
Peninsular and Oriental Mail Steamer for England. Ball<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_346">[346]</span> could not deny himself the
opportunity for a full day’s botanising on ground so attractive,
and therefore removed his baggage ashore; while Hooker returned on
board the <em>Lady Havelock</em>, which was to cross the Strait
during the night.</p>

<p>On arriving at the Victoria Hotel, we learned that Sir J. D. Hay
had taken up his residence at his charming villa on the Djebel
Kebir, but we found awaiting us a kind note enclosing a welcome
packet of letters from England. After a hasty dinner at the hotel,
the time for parting came, and Hooker got out through the sea gate
just before it was closed for the night. The mail steamer had left
Gibraltar for England on the same day that we returned to Tangier;
but on the following morning Hooker found the steamship
<em>Burmah</em>, bound from Bombay to London, about to depart from
Gibraltar, and after a rather slow voyage he reached the Thames on
the morning of June 21.</p>

<p>Ball enjoyed a capital day’s plant-hunting at Tangier. The
morning was given to the sandy tract near the shore and the course
of the stream that passes by the east side of the town. This now
made a much more brilliant show than it had done in the month of
April. Many fine <i>Umbelliferæ</i> and <i>Labiatæ</i>, then barely
in leaf, were now in full flower and fruit. Of these the queen was
<i>Salvia bicolor</i>, a magnificent species, usually four or five
feet, but sometimes eight or even ten feet high, much branched,
with leaves of varied form from twelve to eighteen inches long, and
great interrupted spikes of large blue and white flowers.</p>

<p>The slopes of the Djebel Kebir, which had been so brilliant in
the spring, had now lost their splendour. The gum cistus, the
golden <i>Genista</i> and <i>Cytisus</i>, the heaths, and many
other ornamental species had long since shed their petals, and had
been succeeded by new comers, most of them with comparatively
inconspicuous flowers. For the botanist, however, the fruit is
often more important<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_347">[347]</span> than the flower, and the afternoon was not
long enough to collect all the interesting species that presented
themselves.</p>

<p>On June 14 Ball crossed the Strait from Tangier to Gibraltar in
the ordinary small steamer. While awaiting conveyance to England he
was detained three days, which were made short and agreeable by the
hospitality of Sir W. Fenwick Williams, then governor of the
fortress, and returned to England by a steamer bound from Calcutta
to London, <i>viâ</i> the Suez Canal.</p>

<p>Our large collections reached England by the <em>Lady
Havelock</em>, which arrived only about the end of June, and these,
as well as the cases containing sundry purchases made in Marocco,
were all in good condition.<a id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href=

<p class="csum">Resources of Marocco — Moorish Government a
hopeless failure — Future prospects of Marocco — Objections to
European interference — Answers to such objections.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Scientific</span> travellers,
whose attention was mainly engaged in their own special pursuits,
and whose opportunities for gaining information were restricted by
ignorance of the native languages, have no claim to speak with
authority of the condition and prospects of a country so extensive
as the Marocco Empire. But it would be strange if we had failed to
derive some conclusions from the results of our personal
observation and the information gained on the spot.</p>

<p>Of the material resources of Marocco it is difficult to say too
much. Even under existing conditions, a great portion of the
territory is extremely fertile, and supplies for export a large
amount of agricultural produce. The two natural disadvantages with
which it has to contend are, occasional deficient rainfall and the
ravages of locusts. For the first, the remedy is to be sought in
irrigation. The unfailing streams from the Atlas already serve to a
limited extent; but the area of productive land might by
intelligent management be very largely increased. We have seen an
estimate of the quantity of water discharged by the five principal
streams that fall into the Atlantic north of the Atlas, which fixes
the amount at 9,000 cubic feet per second; and if to these were
added the Moulouya, which falls into the Mediterranean, and the
Siss, the Draha, the Asakka, and the Sous, which drain the southern
slopes of the main chain, we should probably double the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_349">[349]</span> above estimate, and find an
aggregate amount sufficient to irrigate three millions of acres.
These figures must of course be considered as mere guesses; but
there can be no doubt that they indicate a very large reserve of
unused natural resources. With an almost unequalled climate, there
is scarcely any one of the productions of the warmer temperate and
subtropical zones that may not here be obtained. Besides grain, the
country now supplies large quantities of olive oil, dates, oranges,
and almonds, with a little cotton. The latter may be largely
increased; and there seems to be no reason why coffee, tea, sugar,
indigo, and other valuable exotic produce, should not be raised in
the southern provinces.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt of the existence of mineral wealth in the
Great Atlas. We have the direct testimony of Leo Africanus to the
working of mines of copper and iron in the districts visited by
him; and specimens brought by Shelluh mountaineers show that ores
of lead, silver, nickel, and cobalt are likewise to be found. The
forests of the Atlas would, if saved from wanton destruction, be a
further important source of national wealth.</p>

<p>Rich in all the material elements of prosperity, this great
territory, whose area may be roughly estimated at 190,000 square
miles, is cursed by a Government which has in the past wrought
nothing but ruin and degradation, and whose continued existence
forbids the faintest hope of future improvement.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to be more clear than the decadence of the race
who now represent the Arab conquerors of Mauritania. In their
better days they united to martial vigour and skill some aptitude
for progress in arts and learning. Works of public utility were not
unknown; and, at a time when nearly all Europe was plunged in
intellectual darkness, Fez was one of the chief centres of Arabic
culture. The history of the last four centuries in Marocco has been
one of continuous and uninterrupted decline. Unable to establish
their authority over the larger portion of the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_350">[350]</span> region which they claim to govern, the
Sultans have left to anarchy the mountain region into which the
best part of the population was compelled to retire when driven
from the fertile lower country. Over the provinces wherein they are
able to enforce it, the rule of the Moorish Sultans is little else
than an organised system of extortion, in which unchecked license
is given to the agents of the central authority, on the sole
condition of making this the final depository of whatever wealth
the country can produce. The springs of industry and enterprise are
broken; no man can dream of improving his own condition or that of
his family, unless by elaborate fraud and concealment he can hoard
up wealth, which he dare not employ in any way useful to the
community.<a id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>When we inquire what prospect there may be of any escape from
the miserable condition to which Marocco is now reduced, no hopeful
answer can be found. The most sanguine believer in the future of
the Mohammedan races can suggest nothing better than the chance of
the appearance of a Sultan, intelligent and energetic, and powerful
enough to revive the traditions of the better days when rulers took
some thought for the welfare of their subjects, and who might
initiate an era of security and progress. But, to say nothing of
the improbability of the appearance of such a man in a family that
by frequent intermixture with the black race has become more Negro
than Moorish, it seems a pure illusion to imagine that even an
extraordinary man seated on the throne of Marocco, and surrounded
by such agents as he would have at hand, could accomplish salutary
reforms, and, more than that, to suppose that these could have any
permanence. It is conceivable that if the Moor and Arab did not
stand in the way, and the Berber stock were restored to their
original inheritance, a great ruler might overcome their fatal
tendency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[351]</span> to tribal
decomposition, weld them into a nation, and set them on the path of
progress. History affords examples of some such transformation
among vigorous barbarians or semi-savages. But with an effete race,
corrupted by luxury, who have lost the spirit, but preserved many
of the traditions, of a decayed civilisation, no such miracle is to
be worked. Men of great powers, such as one cannot expect to see on
the throne of Marocco, have ere now failed in the attempt, or the
little they have effected has died with them.</p>

<p>No rational believer in progress can cling to the belief that
this is the spontaneous tendency of all branches of the human race,
the ultimate condition to which, with whatever delay, all must
conform. Far from this, all history shows that the task of leading
mankind on the onward road has always been the privilege of a few
races only. The larger part of the earth is even now inhabited by
people either in a stationary or a retrograde condition, and of the
latter state Marocco affords one of the most striking examples.</p>

<p>The one reasonable prospect of improvement in the condition of
Marocco is to be sought in its passing under the control of a
civilised State, strong enough to overcome speedily the inevitable
resistance of the Moorish ruling class, and advanced enough to
consult the welfare of the people it undertakes to govern. If we
ask what European State is by character and circumstances best
fitted for such an undertaking the answer must be—France. Having
already achieved with tolerable success a similar task in the
adjoining region of Northern Africa, the French have every motive
to add to their possessions a territory offering far greater
natural advantages; and it is probable that they would have already
effected the conquest, but for the inevitable jealousy of other
European Powers. The French are not successful colonists; nor have
the economic results of their annexation of Algeria been as
brilliant as might have been expected. But in Marocco
colonisation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span> is not
to be sought or desired. Under a government affording security for
industry the Berber would settle in the unoccupied lands of the
lower country, and carry out under intelligent control the works
which would fit them for a large increase of population.</p>

<p>Many readers who hold to the traditional political ideas of the
past will shrink from the conclusion here expressed. Not concerning
themselves with the results of such a change on the future
condition of Marocco, they will urge that such a great territorial
extension of the French possessions in Africa would increase to a
formidable extent the power of our ancient rival throughout the
Mediterranean region; and they will with justice argue that it is
not for the general interest of the civilised world that any single
Power should obtain a preponderating influence over the rest.</p>

<p>Experience seems to supply an answer to these objections. If
extensive foreign possessions be in some respects a source of
strength to a country, they not less certainly are a cause of
weakness in others; and in the case of a Power not holding maritime
supremacy, the possession of valuable dependencies easily
assailable by sea acts as a weighty check on the aggressive
tendencies of the people.</p>

<p>A cordial acquiescence in the extension of French territory
westward, might reasonably obtain in return a diminution of the
jealousy with which our neighbours view the increase of English
influence on the east side of the African continent. A cynic may
remark that the policy here suggested would resemble an agreement
between freebooters for the division of spoil; but, in truth, we
believe it to be a mistake to suppose that there would be any spoil
to distribute. It is more than doubtful whether any future
extension of the African possessions either of France or England
would more than pay the necessary expenses of occupation and
administration. The gain to both countries would be of a different
order—the outlet provided for the healthful play of energies
cramped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[353]</span> within the
limits of an old society, and the sense, invigorating to the whole
nation, of accomplishing a useful part in the world’s
development.</p>

<p>Objections to every attempt on the part of a modern civilised
State to undertake the government of inferior races have been urged
on various grounds by writers of the highest reputation.</p>

<p>The barriers established by differences in mental condition, in
traditions, and inherited ideas, between peoples in a different
stage of development, are easily shown to create formidable
difficulties in the way of mutual understanding and appreciation,
which must precede all useful efforts to carry the less advanced
races along the path of progress. The history of British India
where, at least during the present century, the experiment has been
tried on the largest scale, and with the most genuine regard for
the welfare of the governed populations, supplies many an example
of the errors inevitable in so difficult an enterprise. Measures
devised with the best intentions have sometimes failed altogether
in achieving the expected effect, or, when this has been attained,
have created discontent, because not corresponding with the ideas
of the native population.</p>

<p>How much better it would be, say objectors of this class, to let
these backward races work out for themselves the problems of
material and mental development, in conformity with the conditions
which nature and history have imposed, than to attempt, in the face
of your own admitted ignorance, to play the part of Providence
towards them.</p>

<p>If the discussion were to turn upon the destiny of a country
wherein the elementary conditions of social order had been secured,
wherein progress of some kind, at however slow a pace, was not an
impossibility, it might be possible to admit the force of these
arguments. But it is forgotten that in point of fact most barbarous
countries have failed to reach this indispensable preliminary
stage.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[354]</span> However
diverse the conditions and the ideas of the human race, the primal
requisites for social order are everywhere the same. Security for
person and property, the protection of the weak against the strong,
tribunals before which justice can be obtained without fear or
favour—where these do not exist, the Power, whatever it may be,
that confers them on a people is a beneficent one, and for the sake
of these any errors that it may commit in its government will be
condoned by posterity.</p>

<p>These remarks apply with especial force to such a country as
Marocco, where, under the yoke of invaders, the greater part of the
population has been for centuries constantly declining in material
and mental condition.</p>

<p>When all has been said, it must be felt that theoretical
considerations are little likely to prevail against that which
history declares to be the uniform condition of human progress. As
a general rule the most vigorous nations are those in which the
increase of population is most rapid, and extension into new
territories is their inevitable destiny. Statesmen and rulers may
to some extent guide and control, but they are powerless to prevent
the operation of natural laws. The choice, in regard to the
inferior races, seems to be whether they shall fall under the rule
of the stronger, and be gradually modified by the influence of new
ideas and institutions, or whether they shall disappear altogether
and give place to the new comer. Where, as has too often happened,
the latter process is effected by injustice and violence, the evil
to the world arises not so much from the loss of a race unfitted to
bear the strain of competition, as from the moral deterioration
that ensues to the invaders.</p>

<p>Amongst the opponents of the extension of European rule over the
adjacent continents must be reckoned those who base their
objections mainly on economic grounds. If the question of the
French occupation of Marocco should arise in a practical shape, it
is little likely that French statesmen will be withheld by
considerations which,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_355">[355]</span> even in England, have not obtained wide
acceptance; and it would be out of place to discuss them here. It
is, indeed, impossible to deny that there is a share of truth in
the views of those who hold that colonies and foreign possessions
do not, as a general rule, directly add to the prosperity of a
country. If the aim of any nation were merely to attain a high
level of material well-being, and it could either restrain its
citizens from intercourse with less civilised people, or be content
to forego the duty of protecting them, it might be possible to
avoid entering on the path which inevitably leads to extension of
territory. Fortunately for the human race, such ideas never have
prevailed among those nations which have played any important part
in history. If the instinct of adventure, that has brought the more
advanced races into contact with the barbarian and the savage, has
always been alloyed by association with the baser passions of some,
it has also been ennobled by the higher aims of others. To lay, in
new regions, the foundations of civil society; to establish, more
or less imperfectly, the reign of order and justice, and to secure
the protection of the weak against the strong—these have been the
tasks hitherto achieved by the ruling races of the world; and as
knowledge has increased, as the difficulties of social progress
have become better understood, and a stricter code of justice in
dealing with the inferior races is gradually becoming established,
it is allowable to hope that the inevitable changes may be
accomplished with less of human suffering and with better
success.</p>

<p>Rome might have been a happier State if its citizens had
confined their ambition to make it a commercial emporium for the
neighbouring tribes of middle Italy, and, content with
self-defence, had refrained from all distant enterprise; Carthage
need not have tempted her fate, if she had been satisfied with her
own corner of Africa; but then the world would have had no history,
and the series of changes from which modern civilisation has been
developed would have been for ages, it may be for ever,
delayed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[356]</span>Of the entire
African continent it may be truly asserted that, with the exception
of the small portions held by England and France, its condition,
for at least thirty centuries, has been either stationary or
positively retrograde. The main cause that has maintained unbroken
the long night of barbarism throughout so vast a region must be
sought in the physical obstacles that prevented the ruling races of
the world from extending their power southwards from the shores of
the Mediterranean. For a time it appeared that the Saracen
conquerors of North Africa were destined to spread the light of a
relatively high civilisation over a great part of the continent.
But that race is effete; it is gradually losing ground; and it
remains for the nations that claim to lead the van in the onward
march of the human race to undertake the work that awaits them.</p>

determining Altitudes of Stations in Marocco.</em>
</p>

<p class="center less space-below15"><span class="sc">By John
Ball</span>.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> instruments provided
for the measuring of heights during our journey in Marocco were, in
the first place, two mercurial barometers belonging to Sir J.
Hooker, which were unfortunately left behind at the last moment by
his attendant who had them in charge. Mr. Ball carried an aneroid
barometer, by Secrétan of Paris, which, during many mountain
journeys before and since, has performed very satisfactorily; and
Mr. Maw had a small pocket aneroid of ordinary construction, not
deserving of much confidence.</p>

<p>At Sir J. Hooker’s request, Mr. Carstensen, then British
Vice-consul, and M. Beaumier, French Consul at Mogador, both
recorded observations of the barometer and thermometer twice daily
(at 10 <span class="sc2">A.M.</span> and 4 <span class=
"sc2">P.M.</span> ) during the period of our stay in and near to
the range of the Great Atlas. Mr. Carstensen’s instrument was a
mercurial barometer, apparently a moderately good instrument; but,
inasmuch as it showed itself more sluggish than M. Beaumier’s
instrument, and the amplitude of its variations was less
considerable, its records do not appear to deserve equal
confidence. On rendering the measurements into millimetres, and
correcting both instruments so as to bring the indications to 0° C.
at the sea level, the observations with the mercurial barometer
fall short of those of the other instrument by a mean difference of
5·5 mm., the chief cause of the discrepancy being apparently due to
the scale of the former being unduly low. Comparing corrected
observations for ten days of very settled weather, during which the
utmost range of either<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_358">[358]</span> instrument did not exceed 2½ millimetres,
we have the mean pressure</p>

<table class="tdl" id="t358">

</table>

<p class="nind">The error of the last-mentioned instrument does not
probably exceed 1 mm. in excess of the true pressure, and, if the
observations of the mercurial barometer were used, it would be
expedient to apply to them a correction of +4·5 mm. But, in
addition to the circumstances already mentioned, it must be noted
that Mr. Carstensen’s observations extend over but eighteen days;
while M. Beaumier’s record covers twenty-six days, from May 11 to
June 5 inclusive. For these reasons it has appeared best to make
use exclusively of the record supplied by M. Beaumier. His
instrument was an aneroid barometer of the construction adopted by
its maker (Leja), called in Paris <i>baromètre holostérique</i>.
The readings were recorded daily at 10 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> and 4 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, and are
carried to intervals of the quarter of a millimetre.</p>

<p>The first questions that arise in applying observations to the
determination of altitudes relate to the corrections applicable to
each instrument. The corrected readings of Secrétan’s aneroid at
Tangiers, and during the voyage between that place and Mogador,
varied from 760 mm. to 761·5 mm., and may safely be assumed to be
nearly correct; but, on arriving at Mogador, they fell
considerably. Inasmuch, however, as on comparison with the
mercurial barometer at the British Consulate the difference was
inconsiderable, the fall was attributed to the condition of the
weather at that time. It was only on our return to Mogador from the
interior, when a direct comparison between Secrétan’s and Leja’s
instruments disclosed a difference of 7·3 mm. between the readings,
and a further comparison between the recorded observations of the
mercurial barometer and M. Beaumier’s instrument showed a
difference of about 5·5 mm. between the scales of those
instruments, that it became clear that Secrétan’s aneroid had
suffered some change at or about the time of landing at Mogador. A
careful comparison of all the observations leaves no ground for
supposing that this arose from any gradual process; and it seems
almost certain that by one of those accidents to which the
best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span> aneroids are
exposed, a casual blow, received about the time of landing at
Mogador, caused the fall of 7 or 8 millimetres which was then
observed. It is quite possible that more complete accuracy would
have been attained by applying a correction of —1 mm. to M.
Beaumier’s observations; but it was thought more convenient to
treat the discrepancy between the instruments as altogether due to
error in Secrétan’s instrument, and to apply to its readings in
South Marocco the correction +7·3 mm. So far as regards the
altitudes determined by comparison with the Mogador observations,
the difference between the method adopted and that above suggested
is quite insensible; but with respect to the altitudes given in the
following table as determined between April 29 and May 10, wherein
the barometric pressure at Mogador is assumed at 760 mm., it is
clear that, if the error of Secrétan’s instrument has been
overcorrected to the extent of 1 millimetre, the altitudes given in
the table should be increased by some 12 or 13 metres.</p>

<p>The next corrections requiring consideration are those arising
from the temperature of the instrument at the time of observation,
and in reference to this point the best makers of aneroid
barometers are much open to criticism. They assert, and with
approximate accuracy, that in the best instruments compensation for
the effect of temperature on the instrument is provided; but they
forget that in order to compare the indications of the aneroid with
those of the mercurial barometer, or to apply to them any of the
formulæ used for calculating altitudes, it is necessary to know at
what temperature the column of mercury stands, the length of which
is assumed to be shown by the scale of the aneroid. In point of
fact, the scale of the latter instrument, when carefully laid down,
is determined by direct comparison with the mercurial barometer
under varying pressures, and the proper course would be to inscribe
on the case of the aneroid a record of the temperature at which
that comparison was made. From inquiries made of some of the best
makers it seems probable that the best approximate correction is
obtained by assuming the reading of the aneroid to correspond with
that of the mercurial barometer at the temperature of 15° C., and
this has been applied in the annexed table.</p>

<p>The height of M. Beaumier’s instrument above the sea
level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span> being about
10 metres, a small correction of +0·9 mm. has been made in order to
obtain the corrected reading adopted in the following table for the
‘Mogador barometer.’</p>

<p>As most of our observations at stations in South Marocco were
necessarily made either early in the morning or late in the
evening, while those at Mogador were registered at 10 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> and 4 <span class="sc2">P.M.</span>, the pressure
at the latter place corresponding to the hour of each of our
observations has been found by intercalation. There is of course an
obvious possibility of error here; but, except on a few occasions,
when the changes of pressure were considerable and rapid, the
amount is probably trifling.</p>

<p>It is familiar to all who have given attention to this subject,
that one of the chief causes of error in the results obtained from
barometric observations for altitude arises from the impossibility,
in the present state of knowledge, of obtaining with tolerable
accuracy the temperature of the stratum of air lying between the
lower and the higher stations. This is especially true in climates
such as that of South Marocco, where the sky is commonly clear, and
the air relatively dry. The cooling of the surface at night, and
the heating in the sunshine by day, have an effect on the layer of
air in contact with that surface, and still more on the traveller’s
thermometer, which at the best is imperfectly protected from
radiation, out of all proportion to the actual cooling or heating
effect on the air not in immediate proximity to the soil. As far as
circumstances permitted, it was sought to take observations about
an hour after sunrise and very soon after sunset, so as to diminish
to the utmost this source of error.</p>

<p>It remains true, in the writer’s opinion, that when all these
sources of error in the determination of heights by means of the
barometer have been put together, there remains one surpassing all
the others in amount which altogether escapes our means of
correction. The formulæ employed for the reduction of observations
to numerical results are, and must be, based on the assumption that
a condition of equilibrium between the forces acting on the
instruments at each station has been attained; whereas the utmost
that can be asserted is that there is a continual tendency towards
such equilibrium, requiring a variable time to effect it. But
before equilibrium can be attained new changes occur, and the
process of adjustment<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_361">[361]</span> recommences. Even as regards stations near
enough to be within sight of each other, repeated observations,
however carefully corrected, give sensibly different numerical
results, and when the stations are widely separated the
discrepancies become serious in amount. The best course for a
traveller in a mountain country is to endeavour to ascertain as
nearly as possible the altitude of some fixed station by taking the
mean of several observations compared with his distant station, and
then to determine the altitude of the higher points reached near to
such fixed station by comparison with an assumed reading of the
barometer at the latter as derived from intercalation.</p>

<p>The altitudes of the stations at Hasni and Iminteli, given in
the following table, derived from several comparisons with the
Mogador readings, are probably nearly correct. That of Arround, as
derived from comparison with Mogador at a time when the
oscillations of pressure were relatively great and rapid, does not
deserve much confidence; and the mean of two comparisons with Hasni
has been preferred, the more readily as this nearly agrees with the
result obtained from a boiling-water observation.</p>

<p>For the reduction of our observations the formula proposed by
Count St. Robert, and first published in the <em>Philosophical
Magazine</em> for 1864, has been preferred, and, for convenience,
the tables based on that formula, published by the same author in
the Memoirs of the Academy of Turin for 1867, have been used.</p>

<p>It is true that in the construction of the latter tables a value
has been assumed for the constant expressing the rate of diminution
of density in the atmosphere corresponding to uniform increase of
altitude that is not constantly correct; but it would appear that
the error resulting from this is but trifling. In regard to the
greatest elevation attained by us in the Atlas, the difference in
the measurement obtained by using the tables from that ascertained
by accurate computation from the formula does not exceed 5
metres.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that the altitudes inserted in some
letters from Sir J. Hooker to the late Sir Roderick Murchison,
which were published in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical
Society for 1871, and also most of those given by Mr. Maw in a
paper presented to the Geological Society in January, 1872, were
roughly calculated at the time when the party were</p>

Secrétan’s aneroid had become apparent. The difference arising from
this and other corrections applicable to the highest points reached
by us is considerable, and requires a deduction of about 500 feet
from the estimated height of the Tagherot pass, and about the same
from the calculated altitude of Djebel Tezah. The corresponding
error in the calculated altitudes for the low country stations,

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> information respecting
the routes here given was supplied by a Jew named Salomon ben
Daoud, an inhabitant of the city of Marocco engaged in trading
operations with the natives of the portions of the Great Atlas
wherein the authority of the Sultan is recognised. In the absence
of more accurate reports, it appears desirable to publish this
slight contribution to the topography of a country altogether
unknown to Europeans, excepting so far as we were able to visit a
few of the places enumerated. To assist those who may hereafter
seek to follow any of these routes, the names of places inserted in
the French map of Marocco by Captain Beaudouin, or in the map
annexed to this volume, are distinguished by an asterisk. The
distances are reckoned by hours, one of which may be counted as
equivalent to four miles in the plain, and to a somewhat lesser
distance in the mountain. A day’s journey usually varies from eight
to ten hours. The spelling of the names is made to agree with that
adopted throughout this work, the vowels having the same sounds as
in most European languages, and not those peculiar to our
country.</p>

<p>From Demenet cross over the river Emhasser, and proceeding for
one hour on the mountain you will reach a place called Iminifri, on
a high mountain, which contains an opening or pass only just large
enough for one person to creep through on his hands and knees, the
length of the pass being about 100 yards; and when through it you
will find open ground on the top of the high mountain. There will
be seen remains (ruins) of old Christian buildings, in which live
many birds. From the upper part of this mountain overhanging parts
(or cliffs) branch out downwards against the mountain, towards the
River Tor, of 500 yards long; but these overhanging parts do not
reach the water of the river.</p>

Acchabi of the French map. The river Tor is probably the Oued

<p>[This route agrees in many respects with the indications of the
French map. The name Aït Chihatchen, there laid down south of
Demenet, is probably the Aït Cid Hassan of the itinerary. It
appears, however, that the importance of the mountain chain on the
north side of the upper valley of the Tessout must be much
exaggerated by the hill-shading on the map. The main chain of the
Atlas is undoubtedly that on the southern side of that valley. The
head of the valley is, on the French map, united to the province of
N’tifa. <i>A priori</i> probability and the wording of the
itinerary suggest that it all belongs to Demenet.]</p>

South Marocco.</em>
</p>

<p class="center less space-below15">By <span class="sc">John
Ball</span>.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Some</span> remarks upon the
geography of South Marocco seem to be called for from a writer who
has ventured to put forth a new map, largely differing from those
hitherto published; but the subject is encompassed with so much
difficulty, and the amount of accurate information available is so
limited, that a prudent writer must be content to regard most of
his own conclusions as merely provisional, and liable to be
modified or set aside by the results of further exploration,
whenever this shall become practicable. In the mean time, some good
may be effected by clearing the ground of some received errors that
are absolutely disproved by facts now ascertained.</p>

<p>Little need here be said of the slight contribution to the
knowledge of South Marocco that can be gleaned from the writers of
antiquity. The earliest document bearing on the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_372">[372]</span> subject was doubtless the
record of the voyage of Hanno, set up in the temple of Saturn at
Carthage. This is known to us only by the version, rendered by an
unknown hand into Greek, which, with all the accumulated errors of
the translator and the subsequent transcribers, has reached us
under the title of the <em>Periplus of Hanno</em>. From this record
the particulars to be gleaned regarding this part of Africa are
scanty and of an uncertain character. Commentators have, with much
probability, identified the Solois promontory of Hanno (Λιβυκὸν
ἀκρωτήριον λάσιον δένδρεσι) with Cape Cantin. But what are we to
make of the next statement that, having passed the cape, they
sailed for half a day east, or south-east (πρὸς ἥλιον ἀνισχοντα),
before reaching the great marshy lake, ‘where elephants and other
wild beasts abounded’? True it is that south of Cape Cantin there
are two slight indentations, mere coves, where the land for a short
distance trends to the south-east; but the general direction for a
mariner along this part of the coast is SSW., as far as Mogador.
Agreeing with the commentators that the ‘great marshy lake’ was
probably near the mouth of the Oued Tensift, we are led to believe
that Hanno disembarked settlers at no less than five stations on
the coast of what is now the province of Haha. If we may rely on
the correctness of the Greek text we must infer that these were
settlements established by the Carthaginians before the date of
Hanno’s expedition.<a id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The next place reached by Hanno was ‘the
great river Lixus, flowing from Libya, about which dwelt a nomadic
people,’ who are called in the text Lixitæ (Λιξίται). It is further
stated that the river is said to flow from great mountains in the
neighbourhood, around which dwell the Troglodytes, referred to in
our text, <a href="#Page_301" class="pginternal">p. 301</a>. The
only assertion that can be confidently made about the Lixus of
Hanno is, that it was quite a different stream from that afterwards
known to the Romans by the same name, the latter being the modern
Oued el Kous, falling into the sea at El Araisch, and which Pliny
makes fifty-seven Roman miles from Tangier. The learned
commentator, C. Müller, identifies the Lixus of the Periplus with
the Draha;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span> but,
unless we assume that great physical changes have occurred during
the interval, this supposition is scarcely compatible with the
existence of a numerous population near the mouth of the river. It
may possibly have been the river Akassa (the native name of the
river of Oued Noun); but it appears far more probable that it was
the Sous, the only one of these rivers which is believed constantly
to discharge a large volume of water into the sea. It may be,
indeed, that there is an etymological connection between the names
Sous and Lixus, as there undoubtedly is between some names still
current and those used by the Romans.</p>

<p>After Hanno, the next voyager along this coast of whom we known
anything was Polybius. The original record of his voyage has,
unfortunately, not come down to posterity, but a few particulars
have been preserved by Pliny.<a id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> We learn incidentally that
the Romans called Cape Cantin promontorium Solis, a name evidently
suggested by the earlier name Solois of the Carthaginians,
afterwards rendered in Greek by Ptolemy ἡλίου ἄκρον. Whether
Polybius succeeded in reaching the Senegal, or some other river
within the tropics, may be uncertain; but he undoubtedly visited
many places on the Atlantic coast of Marocco. We hear for the first
time of the rivers <i>Subur</i> (modern Sebou), and <i>Salat</i>
(the Bouregrag, which falls into the sea at Sallee). He touched at
the port of <i>Rutulis</i>, said to have been eight Roman miles
beyond the mouth of the river Anatis, which was 205 Roman miles
from Lixus (El Araisch). The river is doubtless the modern
Oum-er-bia, and the port was the same which the Portuguese named
Mazagan. The next port touched by Polybius was named
<i>Risadir</i>, which has been with much probability identified
with Agadir.<a id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a> As for the rivers named by Polybius on the coast
south-west of the Atlas, their identification with any known to
modern geographers is purely conjectural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>Of Roman writers
Pliny is the only one from whom any positive information as to the
geography of this part of Africa is to be gained; but even this is
very limited.<a id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> He complains that the reports as to the region
beyond the narrow limits within which Roman power was established
in his day were most fallacious, and censures the Roman authorities
for indolently giving circulation to mendacious stories, instead of
investigating the truth for themselves. In his day Sala (modern
Sallee) was the most southern of the Roman settlements in Marocco.
He describes it as ‘a town standing on a river of the same name, on
the confines of the desert (<i>solitudinibus vicinum</i>), which
was infested by herds of elephants, and still more by the tribe of
the Autololes, through whose territory lay the way to the great
mountain of Africa, the many-fabled Atlas.’ It appears elsewhere
that Pliny had access to the manuscripts left by Juba, which,
unfortunately, have not come down to posterity. That accomplished
prince appears to have held control over the whole territory of
Marocco as far as the base of the Atlas. It is to these lost pages
of Juba that we probably owe the only fragment of moderately
correct information as to South Marocco which is to be found in
Pliny’s work.<a id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> The river Asana, whose mouth is said to be 150
Roman miles beyond Sala, is doubtless the Anatis of Polybius, and
the Oum-er-bia of the Moors. The next river, which he calls Fut, is
the Tensift. The distance assigned for the interval between the
mouth of the Fut and the Atlas is excessive; but not largely so if
Agadir be intended, that being the first place on the coast from
which the high summits of the Atlas are habitually visible. The
statement as to the existence of remains of vineyards and
palm-groves about the ruins of ancient dwellings seems to lend
probability to the belief that the Carthaginian<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span> settlements on this coast may
have had a prolonged existence. The fall of the parent State would
have had but an indirect influence on their destiny. Verbal
resemblances are so often misleading that little weight can be
attached to them; but it is natural to compare the word Dyris, said
by Pliny to be the native name for the Atlas, with that now used by
the natives—<i>Idrarn</i>—this being the plural form of
<i>Adrar</i>, which means generically a mountain, both in the
Shelluh and in several other Bereber dialects.</p>

<p>Besides what Pliny may have learned from King Juba as to the
geography of the coast of South Marocco, he had access to
contemporary testimony as to some part of the interior of the
country. Suetonius Paulinus (the same who at a later date played a
conspicuous part in Britain) being appointed governor of the
provinces of N.W. Africa, then recently incorporated in the Roman
Empire, resolved to penetrate southward beyond the Great Atlas,
whether with a view to intimidate the native tribes, or for the
mere satisfaction of carrying the Roman eagles into a new region.
He appears to have left a written account of his expedition, which,
like so much else of ancient geographical literature, has been
lost. The particulars preserved by Pliny are unfortunately so vague
as to be almost valueless.</p>

<p>In ten days from his starting point, wherever that may have
been, we are told that he reached the highest point of his march.
He reported the mountain to be covered with dense forests of trees
of an unknown kind, and declares the summit of the range to be
deeply covered with snow, even in summer.<a id=
"FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
From the summit of the Atlas Suetonius descended, and marched on
through deserts of black sand, out of which rose here and there
rocks that had the aspect of being burnt, to a river called Ger.
Although it was the winter season the heat of these regions was
found intolerable. The neighbouring forests abounded in elephants
and other wild beasts, and with serpents of every kind, and were
inhabited by a people called Canarians.</p>

<p>The controversies to which this passage has given rise are not
likely to be definitively decided. The balance of
opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[376]</span> leans to
the belief that Suetonius ascended the valley of the Moulouya, and
traversed the Atlas by the pass now called Tizin Tinrout, leading
to Tafilelt. This was the pass traversed by Gerhard Rohlfs in 1864,
and to his narrative alone we can refer for information respecting
it and the country extending southward towards the Great Desert.
The existence in that part of W. Africa, on the south side of the
Great Atlas, so far from the influence of the Atlantic climate, of
vast forests capable of maintaining elephants and sheltering a
native population, would apparently be irreconcilable with existing
physical conditions, and is not readily admissible in the Roman
period. Whatever vigorous vegetation exists in the region traversed
by Rohlfs adjoins the banks of the stream; and, though sand may
encroach here and there, and sun-burnt rocks are seen there, as
elsewhere on the south side of the Atlas, the description is not
what would occur to any one following the course of the stream. It
seems, further, highly improbable that a prudent general, such as
Suetonius Paulinus, would have undertaken to lead an aggressive
military force along the tortuous valley of the Moulouya, some 250
miles in length, enclosed for the most part between lofty
mountains; and it is also to be noted that at the period of his
expedition the Romans held no station in the valley of the
Moulouya, if indeed they ever penetrated far into it.</p>

<p>The few particulars quoted above lead to the conclusion that the
Roman general in his southward march beyond the Atlas did not
follow the course of a stream, but was compelled to cross a tract
of desert before reaching the river of which he speaks, which,
therefore, probably flowed from E. to W. On the whole, it seems to
me that the brief record is more easily reconciled with the
supposition that Suetonius Paulinus made Sala (Sallee), the
farthest Roman station in Western Africa, his base of operations;
that he marched thence across the open country towards SSW., and
gained the summit of the Atlas range at the pass between Imintanout
and Tarudant.<a id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class=
"fnanchor">[7]</a> Between the course of the Sous and that of the
Akassa, or river of Oued Noun, there are extensive tracts of sandy
desert, where, even in winter, his troops may easily have suffered
from heat and thirst; and the river (called Ger) may have been the
main branch, or one of the tributaries of the Akassa flowing from
the range of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
Anti-Atlas. The former existence of great forests, frequented by
elephants, on the flanks of that range, is far more probable than
on the parched southern slopes of the interior, where, as Rohlfs
tells us, the rocks and hills are now absolutely bare of tree and
shrub vegetation. Finally, it is more natural to look for the
ancient Canarians in the country near the Atlantic coast than in
the interior.</p>

<p>The solitary argument of any weight in favour of the Moulouya
and Tafilelt route seems to be derived from the fact that in
descending southward from the pass at the head of the Moulouya
valley the traveller follows the course of a stream which now bears
the name Gers, or Ghir. But it must be remarked that this name
exists elsewhere in Marocco, there being at least three streams so
denominated, and further that it is nowadays borne by the river of
Tafilelt only during a short part of its course. Rohlfs, who is
here our only authority, tells us that the stream first met in
descending from the pass of Tizin Tinrout is called Siss.<a id=
"FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
After following this for seven or eight hours, it is joined by
another stream which he called <i>Ued Gers</i>. The united stream
bears the latter name for a distance of some six hours’ ride, and
then resumes the name of Siss, which it bears throughout its
subsequent course till it is lost in the sands of the Sahara.</p>

<p>The long period that intervened between the decline of Roman
power and the establishment of Mohammedan rule in Marocco, is a
blank to the historian and the geographer. It can scarcely be
doubted that Roman authority and Roman institutions spread
themselves throughout a great part of the open country between the
Atlas and the Atlantic, although there is but little direct
evidence to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>Little reliance
can be placed on the statement of Leo Africanus that the people of
Barbary were converted to Christianity 250 years before the birth
of Mohammed, or about <span class="sc2">A.D.</span> 320, for, in a
country so split up into independent tribes, the new faith must
have made way irregularly and at various periods; while it is most
probable that it never struck root among the mountain tribes of the
Great Atlas. But the positive assertion of the same writer, that
when the Arabs arrived in Marocco they found the Christians masters
of the country, probably holds good of all except the mountain
tracts.</p>

<p>Whether any reliable information as to South Marocco is to be
gleaned from the writings of the eminent Arabian geographers who
lived between the tenth and fourteenth centuries, I am unable to
say; but it seems sufficiently certain that the period of European
exploration leading to practical results commenced in the
fourteenth century. The Genoese, the Catalans, and the Venetians
appear to have despatched several expeditions along the coast, most
of them intended to reach the gold-producing regions of tropical
Africa. The Portuguese, who were destined to outstrip all their
rivals in maritime exploration, were the first to establish
themselves on the western coast of Marocco; and, at one time or
other, they held most, if not all, the Atlantic seaports. Much
information doubtless lies concealed among the mediæval records of
Italy, Spain, and, especially, of Portugal; but up to the present
time nothing has been published to show that any European was able,
from personal knowledge, to give an account of the interior of
Marocco, before Marmol, who, having been taken prisoner by the
Moors, passed several years at Fez and elsewhere in North Marocco,
about the middle of the sixteenth century. The earliest known
document showing a moderately correct knowledge of the coast is a
map (number 5 in the series), contained in the celebrated
<i>Portulano</i> of the Laurentian Library in Florence, bearing the
date 1351.<a id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a> In this map, which, from internal evidence, must
be of Genoese origin, the general outline of the Marocco coast is
correct, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span> the
positions of the few places laid down unmistakable. The now
abandoned town of Fedala (Fidalah), Mefegam (Mazagan), and Mogodor
here appear for the first time. Of early Portuguese maps there must
be many not now known to geographers, and it was certainly from
Portuguese authorities that Gerard Mercator partly derived the
materials used in both editions of his Atlas. In the <i>Atlas
Minor</i>, published by Hondins in 1608, a map of South Marocco is
given in page 567, wherein for the first time an attempt is made to
represent the positions of cities and mountains, and the courses of
rivers in the interior of the country. The outline of the coast is
here less correct than that given in the much more ancient Medicean
map; but there is far more of detail, especially as to places which
were evidently well known to the Portuguese. Thus, as mentioned in
the text, we here for the first time find the island of Mogador
with the name <i>‘I. Domegador.’</i> The places laid down in the
interior appear for the most part to be taken (but with numerous
errors) from the work of Leo Africanus; but the chartographer has
spoiled his map by making the river Sous flow from SE. to NW.,
instead of from NNE. to SSW. Mountains are scattered pretty
uniformly over the map; but what is made to appear as the loftiest
mass, and is marked <i>‘Atlas M.,’</i> with a town named Tagovast
at its foot, stands S. of Tarudant about the western extremity of
the range of Anti-Atlas. The accompanying letterpress, page 566, is
to a great extent derived from Leo Africanus, but with additions
from other sources. It is curious to read that Tarudant, now a
place which no Christian stranger dare approach, was then resorted
to by French and English merchants.</p>

<p>The name of the remarkable man, who stands almost alone as a
geographical authority for the interior of Marocco, has already
been mentioned; but it is impossible to dismiss him so lightly. Leo
Africanus, to give him the name by which he is known to posterity,
was a Moor of Grenada, born in the latter part of the fifteenth
century, who, with his kinsfolk, fled to Fez at or about the time
of the siege of Granada in 1492. In those days Fez was the
head-quarters of Arabic culture; Leo was an earnest and successful
student, and, as a man of learning and intelligence, was taken into
favour by Mouley Ahmet, the founder of the dynasty still reigning
in Marocco. Either in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_380">[380]</span> company with the new ruler, or with his
protection and authority, he travelled through almost every part of
the empire, as well as nearly all the rest of Northern Africa, and
evidently made copious notes. He wrote, in Arabic, various works on
history and grammar which have not been preserved, and, in the same
language, the original version of his description of Africa. It
would appear that he carried this with him, in manuscript, when, in
1517, he was made captive by Christian corsairs, who took him to
Rome. Leo X., hearing that a learned Moor had been brought a
captive to Rome, sent for him, and treated him with kindness and
liberality. A suggestion that he should undergo the rite of baptism
seems to have encountered no obstinate prejudices, for he soon
complied, receiving at the font the Pope’s own names, Giovanni
Leone, and perhaps becoming as earnest a Christian as the Pontiff
himself. He afterwards lived many years in Rome, acquired the
Italian tongue, and translated his work on Africa into that idiom.
This remained for some time unpublished, until it fell into the
hands of Ramusio, who included it in his famous work ‘Delle
Navigationi et Viaggi,’ of which the first edition, in three folio
volumes, was printed in Venice in 1550. It is not easy to account
for the numerous variations between the original text and the
versions which appeared in various languages during the century
following the original publication; but in the absence of
satisfactory explanation it seems safest to accept the text of
Ramusio as alone authentic.</p>

<p>Like most modern readers, the members of our party, when they
resolved to visit Marocco, knew nothing of the work of Leo
Africanus beyond the fact that he is occasionally referred to by
writers on North Africa. The time for preparation was far too short
for extensive reading, and we took with us only the works of
Jackson and Gerhard Rohlfs. It has, however, since that time been a
matter of frequent regret that we had not the opportunity, while
travelling in the country, of referring to the only writer who had
actually seen the greater part of it with his own eyes, and as to
whose general truthfulness there is no room for suspicion. It is
impossible here to enter into the many interesting details that
abound throughout the text; but it is worth while to point out the
more important changes that are disclosed between the condition of
South Marocco as it was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_381">[381]</span> more than three and a half centuries ago,
and that of the present day.</p>

<p>So far as regards the manners, ideas, habits, and mode of living
of the inhabitants, the changes are quite insignificant, save in so
far as these are affected by a general decline in material
prosperity. The central authority was at that period much weaker,
and the separate tribes led a more independent existence. Amongst
the Bereber people of the mountains, and even in many of the larger
towns, such government as existed was ordinarily of the democratic
type. Thus we read that in Tarudant four chiefs were elected to
manage the affairs of the city, holding office for only six months
at a time.</p>

<p>If it were possible to doubt the results of the establishment of
a system of grinding despotism, administered by officials who enjoy
practical impunity so long as they satisfy the pecuniary demands of
their master, the pages of Leo Africanus bring ample evidence. It
is, indeed, true that a slight improvement has ensued as regards
internal tranquillity. There is now rather less of habitual
turbulence; the mutual encounters between neighbouring tribes may
be somewhat less frequent; and brigandage, which appears to have
been not uncommon in the open country, is now comparatively rare.
It may be doubted whether this advantage, such as it is, is not as
much due to diminished population as to the successful
administration of the Moorish Sultans.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence of a general
and progressive decline in prosperity. Throughout the southern
provinces, and especially in Haha and Sous, Leo Africanus found
numerous flourishing towns, most of them visited and described by
him. In each one of these he found people living in comparative
ease, inhabiting good houses with gardens, and possessing,
according to the standard of the age, some literary education. From
the towns, and even from the inner valleys of the Atlas, students
flocked to Fez, then the head-quarters of Arabic knowledge and
civilisation. All the principal places were then local centres of
production, the artificers being principally Jews.</p>

<p>It is notable that excepting the city of Marocco, then full of a
numerous and active population, none of the towns mentioned owed
their foundation to the conquering race. Leo, not<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span> likely to detract from the
achievements of his own people, expressly attributes the origin of
most of them to the ‘antichi Africani,’ by which designation he
commonly speaks of the primitive Bereber stock; and, as regards the
smaller towns lying in the low country north of the Atlas, he
frequently speaks of the population being harassed by the Arabs,
then, as at this day, leading a semi-nomad existence in the
plains.</p>

<p>If we confront his description with the present state of the
country we find comparative ruin and desolation. In all the
southern provinces we now find but two inland cities of any
importance, Marocco and Tarudant, and these dwindled to a mere
tithe of their ancient wealth and population. Where the traveller
in the sixteenth century found thriving towns at intervals of ten
or twelve miles, there are now miserable villages whose wretched
inhabitants maintain a bare existence, and are often unable to pay
the imposts which leave no surplus behind. It does not appear that
in the great province of Haha there is now a single place that can
be called a town except the ruined seaport of Agadir, destined by
nature to be the chief port of South Marocco, but closed to trade
by the caprice of a Sultan. Throughout the interior we saw or heard
of but two places that could by courtesy be called towns, Amsmiz
and Moulai Ibrahim. Although no statistics are available, it seems
a moderate estimate if we reckon that the present population of
South Marocco cannot exceed one-third of what it was when Leo
wrote.</p>

<p>Along with the decay of wealth and population, we naturally find
that of everything that could raise the people in the scale of
existence. In Leo’s day iron and copper mines were worked in many
places in the Atlas, and various handicrafts exercised, of which
there is now no trace. Education, such as it was, was widely
spread; and in some parts of the Atlas where it was absent, the
traveller noted the fact as a proof of the low condition of the
population. He notes as a curious incident that when he visited the
mountain district of Semele, where the people were ignorant of
reading and writing, they forced him to remain nine days, hearing
and deciding all pending cases of litigation; in doing which, as he
records, he had to act both as judge and notary, there being no one
competent to write down the decisions of the court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>Several
incidental statements in the work of Leo Africanus suggest an
inquiry of considerable interest. There is nothing in the published
annals of the Portuguese wars with the Moors to suggest a belief
that the former at any time established their authority in the
interior of South Marocco, or even undertook any inland
expeditions. From Leo’s narrative it appears, however, that, at the
beginning of the sixteenth century, they had, at least
occasionally, penetrated much farther into the interior than has
commonly been supposed, and that the authority of the Portuguese
king was in some places paramount. At Tumeglast, a place in the
plain of Marocco, probably not far from the present village of
Frouga, Leo lodged in the house with a Moor, named Sidi Yehie, who
had come in the name of the king of Portugal to levy tribute, the
same Moor having been made by the king chief (capitano) of the
district of Azasi. Elsewhere he relates that the king of Marocco
sent an expeditionary force against an independent chief in the
district of Hanimmei, forty miles east of the city of Marocco
(apparently in the present province of Demnet), and which force was
accompanied by 300 Portuguese cavalry. The expedition was
unsuccessful, the Sultan’s troops were defeated, and, according to
the narrative, not one of the Christian horsemen returned from the
disaster. It seems highly improbable that the Portuguese should
have taken part in such an affair if their troops had not at the
time been stationed somewhere in the interior.</p>

<p>After Leo Africanus but little of a definite kind is to be
learned from subsequent writers as to the geography of South
Marocco. In 1791 the reigning Sultan applied to General O’Hara,
then Governor of Gibraltar, for the assistance of an English
physician to treat his favourite son, Mouley Absalom, who was at
the time governing the province of Sous. Mr. Lempriere, an
army-surgeon, undertook the office, and travelled by the west coast
to Agadir, and thence to Tarudant. After successfully treating his
patient, he was partly induced, and partly forced, to travel to the
city of Marocco, whence, after considerable delay and difficulty,
he succeeded in returning to Gibraltar. Mr. Lempriere probably
travelled across the Atlas by the road from Tarudant to Imintanout,
but his narrative supplies little information to the geographer. He
speaks of the distance from Tarudant to the northern foot of the
Atlas as an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span> easy
journey of three days, and describes the track as leading beneath
and along tremendous precipices.</p>

<p>Frequent reference is made in the text to Jackson’s ‘Account of
the Empire of Marocco,’ of which the first edition appeared in
1809, and the third in 1814. This is undoubtedly the fullest and
most correct modern work on Southern Marocco. Jackson spent sixteen
years in the country, chiefly at Mogador and Agadir; he acquired
the familiar use of the Moorish Arabic, and seems to have obtained
merited influence among the natives. Either because he had but
little taste for exploration, or because he found the difficulties
too serious, Jackson has added little to our knowledge of the
geography of the country. His map, though it contains some
corrections, is on the whole inferior to that of Chénier, published
a century earlier.</p>

<p>A definite contribution to the slight existing amount of
positive knowledge was made by the late Admiral Washington, then a
lieutenant in the navy, who accompanied the late Sir J. Drummond
Hay on his mission to the city of Marocco in the winter of
1829-1830. His paper, published in the first volume of the ‘Journal
of the Royal Geographical Society,’ is frequently referred to in
our text; and in the accompanying map the positions of several
points in the interior of the country were accurately laid down
from astronomical observation.</p>

<p>A most important step towards extending our knowledge of the
entire empire of Marocco was made in 1848, when the French War
Department published the map compiled by Captain Beaudouin.
Whatever errors it may contain—and these were unavoidably
numerous—this must be regarded as a monument of intelligence and
industry. Recognising the fact that the greater part of the
territory is likely long to remain inaccessible to Europeans, the
author applied himself to obtaining information from natives who
were personally acquainted with various portions of the country.
Hundreds of such informants, as we were assured, were separately
examined by Captain Beaudouin; the information supplied by each was
laid down on a skeleton map; and by the careful comparison of the
separate materials the general map was compiled.</p>

<p>Without noticing minor errors, which are, of course, inevitable
in such a work, the most serious objection to be made
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[385]</span> this map is that
the orography is exhibited in a fashion <i>primâ facie</i>
improbable, and which has been to a great extent negatived by
subsequent evidence. The main range of the Southern Atlas is
represented as a nearly straight wall, over 400 miles in length,
with few and short diverging ridges, and, parallel to this on the
south side, another equally straight and narrow ridge is made to
stretch for nearly 300 miles. From near the eastern extremity of
the main range two other straight ridges are shown, diverging
abruptly at an acute angle, and enclosing a trench-like valley that
extends north-west for fully 120 miles. If this were even
approximately correct, we should be led to conclude that the
structure of the Great Atlas is quite unlike that of any other
known mountain region. The tendency of mountain ranges to follow a
uniform general direction is always modified by the numerous
secondary causes that have helped to fashion the earth’s
surface.</p>

<p>The first recent traveller who succeeded in penetrating some
considerable portions of the Marocco territory was M. Gerhard
Rohlfs. Assuming the garb and professing the faith of a Mussulman,
he traversed many districts where no Christian dare present
himself; but the care necessary to prevent his real character from
becoming known imposed severe restrictions on M. Rohlfs. Produced
under conditions where it was impossible to be seen taking notes or
using any scientific instrument, it is not surprising that the
narrative of his adventurous journey is extremely meagre; but even
for the little that he is told about a region so little known the
reader is thankful. The chief geographical results of these
journeys were embodied in the map annexed to G. Rohlfs’ first
work<a id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class=
"fnanchor">[10]</a> by the eminent geographer, M. Petermann. The
scale of that map is small and admits of little detail; but, so far
as regards the mountain country, I am disposed to think that the
direct evidence, supplemented in some points by native report,
requires us to depart more widely from the orographic features of
Beaudouin’s map than M. Petermann has thought it fit to do.</p>

<p>In the map accompanying this volume I have ventured, in addition
to the changes for which I had direct authority, to introduce a few
others, avowedly conjectural, which must await further exploration
before they can be either adopted or condemned.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span> It is difficult to believe
that in an age when the barriers that have closed the other least
known regions of the earth are successively removed, Marocco, so
close to Europe and so attractive, can alone resist the progress of
modern exploration.<a id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53"

<p class="center less space-below15"><span class="sc">By Joseph
Dalton Hooker</span>.</p>

<h3><em>Gum Ammoniacum.</em>
</h3>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Our</span> endeavours to obtain
accurate information regarding the Marocco gum ammoniac plant were
ceaseless and fruitless. Jackson, who gives a rude figure of a
portion of a leaf and a scanty description (‘Account of the Empire
of Marocco,’ 136, t. 7), says that it is the produce of a plant
like Fennel, but larger, and called Fashook in Arabic, and that it
grows in the plains of the interior provinces, abounding in the
north of the city of Marocco, in a sandy light soil. Jackson
further states that neither bird nor beast is seen where this plant
grows, the vulture only excepted, and that it is attacked by a
beetle having a long horn proceeding from its nose, with which it
perforates the plant, and makes the incisions whence the gum oozes
out. Under his description of the vulture, he states that, with the
exception of the ostrich, this is the largest bird in Marocco; that
it is common in all places where the gum<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_387">[387]</span> ammoniac grows, as in the plains east of El
Araiche,<a id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> where he has seen at least twenty of these birds
in the air at once, darting down on the insects with astonishing
rapidity (p. 118). Jackson’s figure (t. 8) of the so-called beetle
apparently represents a dipterous insect resembling a Bombylius,
with a very long straight proboscis.</p>

<p>Lindley (‘Flora Medica,’ 46) doubtfully refers Jackson’s Fashook
to the eastern <i>Ferula orientalis</i> L.; and Flückiger and
Hanbury (‘Pharmacographie,’ 289) say that, according to Lindley,
the <i>Ferula tingitana</i> yields a milky gum resin, having some
resemblance to Ammoniacum, which is an object of traffic with Egypt
and Arabia, where it is employed like the ancient drug in
fumigations. The authors go on to say that there can be but little
doubt that the Maroccan Ammoniacum is identical with that of the
ancients, and that it may well have been imported by way of Cyrene
from regions lying farther westward.</p>

<p>Pliny and Dioscorides say that the Ammoniacum is the juice of a
Narthex growing about Cyrene and Libya, and that it is produced in
the neighbourhood of the temple of Ammon.</p>

<p>Dr. Leared (‘Morocco and the Moors,’ 356) was informed that the
Fashook grows at a place two days’ journey from Mogador, on the
road to the city of Marocco,<a id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but states that the
exudation from the roots of specimens which he obtained differed
from the African Ammoniacum. We, on the other hand, were
persistently assured that it grew nowhere along that route, nor
nearer to it than El Araiche, north of Marocco city. And this is
confirmed by information obtained by Mr. R. Drummond Hay to the
effect that it is found near Marocco, and chiefly around Tedla. The
Moors who gave us this information at once recognised the figure by
Jackson, and called the plant Kilch (Kelth according to Leared).
The roots presented to Kew by the kindness of Dr. Leared did not
make any indications of growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>The Maroccan
Ammoniacum plant must not be confounded with the Persian <i>Dorema
Ammoniacum</i>, or ‘Ushak,’ which is also bled by insects.</p>

<p>The Fashook gum is used by the Moors and by some Orientals as a
depilatory, and in skin diseases; it is exported to the East from
Mazagan, <i>viâ</i> Gibraltar and Alexandria.</p>

<h3><em>Euphorbium, Furbiune or Dergmuse.</em>
</h3>

<div class="nomen">
<p><i>Euphorbia resinifera</i>.—Berg. und Schmidt, Officinelle
Gerwächse, v. iv. (1863) xxxiv. d.; Flückiger and Hanbury,
Pharmacographia, 502; Cosson, in Bull. Soc. Bot. Fr. xxi. 163;
Ball, in Journ. Linn. Soc. Bot. xvi. 661; Euphorbium, Jackson’s
‘Account of the Empire of Marocco,’ 134, t. 6 (left-hand figure
only).</p>
</div>

<p>We have little to add to the description of the Euphorbium tree
given by Jackson, and that in the ‘Pharmacographia’ cited above. As
stated in the body of this work it is confined to the interior of
the empire, and the only living specimens we met with were from a
garden in Mesfiouia (see <a href="#Page_163" class="pginternal">p.
163</a>). Jackson confounded two plants under this name; one, the
true species, growing in the Atlas, with 3-4-angled branches, the
other a sea-coast plant, with 9-10-angled branches, which is
carried to Marocco for tanning purposes, and of which he says, that
during the three years of his residence at Agadir he never saw any
gum upon it.</p>

<p>The true plant is figured and described by Jackson as an erect
tree, with a stout short woody trunk, and very numerous upcurved
long sparingly divided branches, the whole resembling a
candelabrum. The angles of the branches are armed with short
spines, and the flowers are produced from the tips of the young
shoots. The thorns adhere to everything that touches them, and he
supposes them to have been intended by nature ‘to prevent cattle
from eating this caustic plant, which they always avoid on account
of its prickles.’ The juice flows from incisions made with a knife,
and hardens and drops off in September. The plants, he says,
produce abundantly once only in four years, and the fourth year’s
produce is more than all Europe can consume. The people who collect
the gum are obliged to tie a cloth over their mouths and nostrils,
to prevent the small<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_389">[389]</span> dusty particles from annoying them, as they
produce incessant sneezing.</p>

<p>The history of the Euphorbium as given in the ‘Pharmacographia’
is, that it was known to both Dioscorides and Pliny as a native of
the Atlas, and was named in honour of Euphorbus, physician to the
learned King Juba II. of Mauritania, himself the author of
treatises on Opium and Euphorbium.</p>

<p>The prevalence of cactoid <i>Euphorbiæ</i> in Marocco, of which
there are three species in the southern districts, is a similar
instance to that of the Argan, of tropical forms advancing far
north in the extreme west of the old world; and as the Argan has
its nearest ally in Madeira, so have the Maroccan Euphorbiums close
congeners in the Canary Islands. All these belong to the section
<i>Diacanthium</i> of Boissier, of which the other species are
Abyssinian, Arabian, Indian, and South African.</p>

<p>Gum Euphorbium was extensively used by early practitioners as an
emetic and purgative, and was exported in large quantities; now,
however, the trade in it is rapidly declining, and we were informed
that it is chiefly used in veterinary practice, and as an
ingredient in a paint for the preservation of ships’ bottoms.</p>

<p><i>Euphorbia resinifera</i> is in cultivation at Kew, where
specimens may be seen both in the Succulent-plant House and
Economic-plant House.</p>

<p>This tree is a native of the mountains of North Africa, from the
Atlantic to Eastern Algeria; but we are not aware whether its
eastern limit has ever been accurately determined. It has no
congener, its nearest ally being a South African genus of Cypresses
(<i>Widdringtonia</i>), of which several species are
recorded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[390]</span> from the
Cape Colony, Natal, and Madagascar, and which differ in having
alternate leaves and many ovules to each scale.</p>

<p>The great interest attached to this plant arises from the beauty
and durability of the wood, which, there is every reason to
believe, was known to the ancients from the earliest times, under
the name of Thuja. It is thus hypothetically, but probably
correctly, identified with the θυῖον<a id=
"FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
of the Odyssey (ii. 6), with the θυῖον and θυία of Theophrastus
(‘Hist. Pl.’ v. 5), and the thyine wood of the Revelations (xviii.
12). It is undoubtedly the Citrus wood of the Romans, and the
Alerce of the Spaniards; the latter name being derived from the
Moors of Marocco, for it is not a native of Spain.</p>

<p>The first botanical notice of the Callitris is in Shaw’s
‘Travels in Barbary,’ where it is figured and briefly described as
<i>Thuja articulata</i> (462); and for its identification with the
Alerce we are indebted to the late Mr. Drummond Hay when Consul of
Tangier, who, further, sent a plank of the wood to the Royal
Horticultural Society.<a id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> At about the same time, the
attention of a most intelligent traveller, the late Capt. S. E.
Cook (afterwards Widdrington), was attracted by the wood of the
cathedral of Cordova (formerly a mosque built by the Moors in the
ninth century) called Alerce, which differed from any Spanish wood,
or any other wood now used in Spain. Coupling this name with the
communication made by Mr. Drummond Hay to the Horticultural
Society, Capt. Cook was enabled to identify the Cordova wood with
the Callitris, which, as he assumes, was brought from Marocco, to
roof a mosque intended to be second in sanctity only to that of
Mecca.</p>

<p>Except in a garden at Tangier, we saw no specimen of the
Callitris approaching a large size, or capable of yielding the
beams which we were shown in the ceilings and roofs of buildings in
that town and elsewhere, and which are considered to be
indestructible. On the contrary, most of the native specimens we
saw in Southern Marocco resembled small Cypresses, with very sparse
foliage and branches, and were apparently<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_391">[391]</span> shoots from the stumps of trees that had
been cut or burnt down, though possibly their impoverished habit
may have been due to the sterility of the soil. The largest were in
the Ourika valley, and were about thirty feet high (see <a href=
"#Page_177" class="pginternal">p. 177</a>). In many cases the stem
swelled out at the very base into a roundish mass half buried in
soil, which is said to attain even four feet in diameter, though we
saw none approaching that size.</p>

<p>It is the basal portion, whether the result of mutilation or
natural growth, that affords the wood so prized by ancients and
moderns, and which forms a most valuable article of export from
Algiers to Paris, where small articles of furniture, &amp;c., are
made of it and sold at very high prices.</p>

<p>Under the name of Citrus wood, it is alluded to, according to
Daubeny, by Martial and Lucan, and by Horace (‘Carm.’ lib. iv. Od.
1), who suggests its employment as the most precious commodity that
could be selected for a temple in which a marble statue of Venus
should be placed:—</p>

<p>Also Petronius Arbiter, descanting upon the luxury of the
Romans, seems to represent it as worth more than its weight in
gold, when he says—</p>

</div>

<p>For a detailed description of what was known of this tree to the
ancients, and of its value, we must refer to the description in
Pliny (‘Nat. Hist.’ book xiii. chaps. 29, 30). This author
describes it as the thyion and thyia of Homer and the Greeks, and
adds that its wood was used with the unguents burnt for their
pleasant odour by Circe; as also that Theophrastus awarded a high
rank to it, the timber being used for roofing temples and being
indestructible; as also that it is produced in the lower part of
Cyrenaica, and that the finest kind grows in the vicinity of the
temple of Jupiter Ammon.</p>

<p>Pliny himself gives Mount Atlas as the native country of the
wood; in the vicinity of which, he says, is Mauritania, a country
in which abounds a tree which has given rise to the
mania<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[392]</span> for fine
tables, an extravagance with which women reproach the men when they
complain of their vast outlay upon pearls. He attributes the knots
from which the tables are made to a disease or excrescence of the
roots, of which the most esteemed are entirely concealed under
ground, these being much more rare than those which are produced
above ground, and that are to be found on the branches also.</p>

<p>The principal merits of the tables were to have veins arranged
in waving lines, or forming spirals like whirlpools. The former
they called ‘tiger’ and the latter ‘panther’ tables; whilst others,
which are highly esteemed, have markings resembling the eyes on a
peacock’s tail. In others, again, called ‘apiatæ,’ the wood appears
as if covered with dense masses of grain. The most esteemed colour
was that of wine mixed with honey.</p>

<p>In respect of their size, Pliny gives a little over 4 ft. as the
average maximum, though one that belonged to Ptolemæus, King of
Mauritania, was 4½ ft. in diameter and ¼ of a foot in thickness. It
was formed of two semi-diameters so skilfully united that the
joining was concealed. Another, made of a single piece, was named
after Nonius, a freedman of Tiberius Cæsar, and was 4 ft. less ¾
in. in diameter, and 5¼ inches in thickness. And with regard to the
price, Cicero paid a million sesterces (9,000<em>l</em>.) for one;
two belonging to King Juba were sold by auction, one for one
million two hundred thousand sesterces, and the other for somewhat
less. Some of Pliny’s statements are probably fabulous; as that the
barbarians bury the wood when green, first giving it a coating of
wax, and that the workmen, when it comes into their hands, put it
for seven days beneath a heap of corn, and then take it out for as
many more, after which it is surprising to find how much it has
lost in weight. More apocryphal still is his statement that it is
dried by the action of sea-water, and thereby acquires a hardness
and density that render it proof against corruption; also that, as
if created for the behoof of wine, it receives no injury from
it.<a id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>In Marocco, where no ornament or article of luxury is known, it
need hardly be said that the Alerce wood is employed only for
building purposes and fire-wood; though the resin<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span> called Sandarach, which was
once a reputed medicine, is collected by the Moors and exported
from Mogador to Europe, where it is used as a varnish.</p>

</div>

<p>Of this plant very little indeed is known, and we were
unfortunately unable to find either flower or fruit of the only
Acacia which we met with on our visit to Marocco, and which we were
assured was the Gum Arabic plant (Alk Tlah) of that country. It is
interesting as representing the northern limit of distribution of
the immense genus Acacia in Africa. Our specimens, such as they
are, coincide perfectly with the description of <i>Acacia
gummifera</i> in Willdenow, and with the excellent figure in Hayne,
which was taken from specimens collected by Broussonet near
Mogador. We found the plant abundantly in the lower region of
Southern and Western Marocco, occurring as a thorny bush, along
with <i>Rhus pentaphylla</i> and other shrubs. That it was the
plant producing the Marocco Gum Arabic the natives consistently
testified, though this could not be inferred from the description
in Jackson’s ‘Account of the Empire of Marocco’ p. 136, who says of
the gum that it ‘is produced from a high thorny tree called
Attalet, having leaves similar to the Arar, or gum Sandarac tree,
and the Juniper.’ Jackson goes on to say:—</p>

<p>‘The best kind of Barbary gum is procured from the trees of
Marocco, Ras-el-wed, in the province of Abda; the secondary
qualities are the produce of Shedma, Duquella, and other provinces;
the tree grows abundantly in the Atlas mountains, and is found also
in Bled-el-jerrêde. The gum, when new, emits a faint smell, and,
when stowed in the warehouse, it is heard to crack spontaneously
for several weeks; and this cracking is the surest criterion of new
gum, as it never does so when old;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_394">[394]</span> there is, however, scarcely any difference
in the quality. The Attaleh is not so large a tree as the Arar,
which produces the Sandarac gum, nor does it reach the size of the
Auwar tree, which produces the gum Senegal. It has a low crooked
stem, and its branches, from the narrowness of its leaves (long and
scanty), have a harsh, withered, and unhealthy appearance at the
time it yields the most gum—that is, during the hot and parching
months of July and August; but although not an ornamental tree, it
is a most useful plant, and will always be considered valuable. Its
wood is hard, and takes a good polish; its seeds, which are
enclosed in a pericarpium, resemble those of the Lupin, yield a
reddish dye, and are used by the tanners in the preparation of
leather. These seeds attract goats, who are very fond of eating
them. The more sickly the tree appears, the more gum it yields; and
the hotter the weather, the more prolific it is. A wet winter and a
cool or mild summer are unfavourable to the production of gum.’</p>

<p>As observed in the body of this work, the gum does not seem to
be collected in the western portion of its range in South Marocco,
but in Demnet, whence it is brought to Mogador; and it may very
well be that it is only in the hotter and drier regions of the
interior that the gum is produced in sufficient quantities to be
worth collecting.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that no notice whatever of <i>Acacia
gummifera</i> occurs in Flückiger and Hanbury’s invaluable
‘Pharmacographia’ (1874), where the Marocco gum is supposed to be
the produce of <i>Acacia arabica</i> Willd., a plant which extends
from Nubia to Natal, and eastward to Central India, but which is
not known as a native of Marocco. In another passage of the above
work (p. 211), the ‘Marocco, Mogador, or brown Barbary gum,’ is
described as consisting ‘of tears of moderate size, often
vermiform, and of a rather uniform light dusky brown tint. The
tears, which are internally glassy, become cracked on the surface
and brittle if kept in a warm room; they are perfectly soluble in
water.’</p>

<p>It is possible that the <i>Acacia arabica</i>, which is found in
Senegal, may extend to the Sous Valley, and be the source of some
of the Marocco gum; and that more than one species producing gum
are confounded together by the Moors; this is the natural inference
from Jackson’s account, itself anything<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_395">[395]</span> but explicit. On the other hand, I am
informed in a letter lately received from Mr. R. Drummond Hay,
H.B.M. Consul at Mogador, who has kindly had inquiries made for me,
that the <i>Acacia arabica</i> (Alk Awarwhal) is not found in Sous,
no tree of the kind existing either north or south of the Atlas,
but that its gum is brought from Soodan by Arabs, and is of
inferior quality to that of the <i>Acacia gummifera</i>. Mr. Hay
further informs me that the <i>Acacia gummifera</i> grows chiefly
in the provinces of Blad Hamar, Rahamma, and Sous.</p>

<p>As stated above, the specimens which we collected of <i>Acacia
gummifera</i> precisely accord with the published description and
drawing; but we have others under this name from Mr. Cosson’s
collector, Ibrahim, gathered near Mogador and at Ouanyna, which
differ in having very short spines, ⅙ to ¼ in. long, whilst those
of our plant are from ⅔ to ¾ in. long and much stouter.</p>

<p>Very small plants of <i>Acacia gummifera</i> are living at Kew,
raised from seeds obligingly presented by Mr. Cosson. They grow
exceedingly slowly, and several have been lost by damping off. They
are not in a state fit for exhibition.</p>

<p><i>Argan</i>.—Dryandr. in Trans. Linn. Soc. ii. 225.</p>
</div>

<p>This tree is rightly regarded as the most interesting vegetable
production of Marocco, being confined to that empire and to a very
circumscribed area in it, belonging to an almost exclusively
tropical natural family, yielding a most important
article<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[396]</span> of diet to
the inhabitants, and a wood that for hardness and durability rivals
any hitherto described. The earliest account of the Argan tree
known to us is a brief one by the celebrated African traveller Leo
Africanus, who visited Marocco in 1510. Speaking of some of the
customs of the Moors, Leo Africanus says: ‘Unto their Argans (for
so they call a kind of olive which they have) they put nuts; out of
which two simples they express a very bitter oil, using it for a
sauce to some of their meats, and pouring it into their lamps’
(‘Purchas,’ ii. 772). And in another passage he describes the oil
correctly, as ‘of a fulsome and strong savour.’ The further history
of the Argan tree is given in a very full and careful account by
the late Sir W. Hooker, in the ‘London Journal of Botany’ for 1854
(vol. vi. p. 97, Tab. iii. iv.), which, as the work is of limited
circulation, we here introduce.</p>

<p>‘Through the kindness and by the exertions of the Earl of
Clarendon, Chief Secretary for Foreign Affairs, the Royal Gardens
of Kew have been put in possession of living plants and fresh seeds
of a tree or shrub very little known in Europe, little known even
to botanists, but highly esteemed by the Moors, in those parts of
Marocco where it is a native, for its useful qualities, viz. the
“Argan.” Its economical properties are best explained by the copy
of a letter which his Lordship did me the favour to communicate
along with the plants and seeds, from Henry Grace, Esq., British
Acting Vice-Consul at Mogador, addressed to J. H. Drummond Hay,
Esq., Her Britannic Majesty’s Agent and Consul-General at Tangier;
both of which gentlemen spared no pains in procuring the
information and seeds and living specimens; an example we should be
glad to see followed by our consuls in other countries abounding in
new and useful plants.</p>

<p class="right">‘“Mogador, November 7, 1853.</p>

<p>‘“Sir,—The Argan tree grows more or less throughout the states
of Western Barbary, but principally in the province of Haha, and
south of this town. The soil in which it is found is light, sandy,
and very strong; it is usually seen upon the hills, which are
barren of all else, and where irrigation is impossible.</p>

<p>‘“I should imagine, from the appearance of some of the trees,
that they are from one to two hundred years old; and a remarkably
large one in this neighbourhood is probably at least<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_397">[397]</span> three hundred. This individual
measures 26 ft. round the trunk; at the height of three feet it
branches off; the branches (one of which measures 11 ft. in
circumference near the trunk) rest upon the ground, extending about
15 ft. from the trunk, and again ascend. The highest branch of this
tree is not more than 16 ft. to 18 ft. from the ground, while the
outer branches spread so as to give a circumference of 220 ft.:
this is the largest I am aware of.</p>

<p>‘“The mode of propagation, in this vicinity, is mostly by seed.
When sowing this, a little manure is placed with it, and it is well
watered until it shoots; from which period it requires nothing
further. In from three to five years after sowing it bears fruit,
which ripens between May and August (according to the situation of
the tree). The roots extend a great distance underground, and
shoots make their appearance at intervals, which are allowed to
remain, thus doing away with the necessity of transplanting or
sowing. When the fruit ripens, herds of goats, sheep, and cows are
driven thither; a man beats the tree with a long pole, and the
fruits fall and are devoured voraciously by the cattle. In the
evening they are led home, and, when comfortably settled in their
yards, they commence chewing the cud and throw out the nuts, which
are collected each morning as soon as the animals have departed
upon their daily excursion. I have heard it remarked that the nut
passes through the stomach; but this is only a casualty, and not a
general rule. Large quantities of the fruit are likewise collected
by women and children: they are well dried, and the hull is taken
off, and stored for the camels and mules travelling in the winter,
being considered very nutritious.</p>

<p>‘“The process of extracting the oil is very simple. The nuts are
cracked by the women and children (and not a few fingers suffer at
the same time, owing to the want of proper tools, for the nuts are
very hard, and a stone is the only implement used); the kernels are
then parched in a common earthen vessel, ground in handmills of
this country, and put into a pan; a little cold water is sprinkled
upon them, and they are well worked up by the hand (much the same
as kneading dough) until the oil separates, when the refuse is well
pressed in the hand, which completes the process. The oil is left
to stand, and the sediment removed. The cake (in which a great deal
of oil remains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[398]</span>
owing to the want of a proper press) is generally given to the
milch cows or goats.</p>

<p>‘“I never heard of any part being used as manure, but I have no
doubt it would form an excellent one.</p>

<p>‘“Some of these Argans grow in clusters, others are in single
trees.</p>

<p class="space-above15">‘Except a brief notice of the exportation
into Europe of Argan oil by the Danish Councillor of State, Georges
Höst, who travelled in the kingdoms of Marocco and Fez during the
years 1766-1768, the only published account of the uses of the
Argan is given in a very little known Danish work, published by P.
K. A. Schousboe, entitled “Iagttagelser over Væxtriget i Marokko.
Forste Stycke. Kiobnhavn, 1800, 4, 7 Tab.,” of which a German
edition appeared in 1801, in 8vo, by J. A. Markussen. It gives an
account of some Marocco plants; and, after an introductory sketch
of the physical geography of Marocco, it contains descriptions of
the plants of the country in Latin and German, with occasional
observations in German. The account of the Argan under Retz’s name
of <i>Elæodendron Argan</i> is long: first comes a technical
description, followed by a history of its synonymy, and then the
following notes (kindly translated for us by Mr. Bentham):—</p>

<p>‘“It is surprising that this tree should hitherto have been so
little known; as it is found in a country near Europe, and visited
by many travellers, who speak in their diaries and descriptions of
oil of Argan and of Argan trees, these last as constituting a
considerable proportion of the forests of the country. It is,
however, not to be met with in the northern provinces, but only
towards the south. All those persons, from whom I have sought more
accurate information on the subject, are unanimous in stating that
it only grows between the rivers Tansif and Sus—that is, between
the 29° and 32° N. lat.—and there constitutes forests of
considerable extent. It flowers in the middle of June, and the
fruit remains on the tree the greater part of the year. The young
fruit sets in the end of July or beginning of August, and grows
slowly till the rainy season<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_399">[399]</span> commences, towards the end of September. It
now enlarges rapidly and attains its full size during that season,
so as that by the middle or end of March it is ripe enough to be
gathered for economical uses. Both the fruit and the wood are
serviceable, but especially the former; for from the kernel an oil
is extracted which is much employed for domestic purposes by the
Moors, and is an important production of the country, as it saves
much olive oil, which can thus be thrown into commerce, and made to
bring money into the country. It is calculated that in the whole
Argan region one thousand hundredweight of oil is annually
consumed, thus setting free an equal quantity of olive oil for
exportation to Europe. Our countryman, Höst, in his ‘Efterretninger
om Marokos,’ p. 285, says that the Argan oil is exported to Europe,
where it is used in manufactures. Such may have been the case in
former times when it might be cheaper; but now there would be no
advantage in doing so, as it costs almost as much as olive oil. At
present, no Argan oil whatever is exported.</p>

<p>‘“As the practice in preparing this oil is somewhat different
from that of common olive oil, it may be useful to enter into some
details on the subject. I have myself been present during the whole
operation, and consequently speak from experience.</p>

<p>‘“In the end of March the countryman goes into the wood, where
the fruits are shaken down from the trees and stripped of their
husks on the spot. The green fleshy pericarp, which is good for
nothing else, is greedily eaten by ruminating animals, such as
camels, goats, sheep, and cows, but especially by the first two.
Therefore, when the Arab goes into the woods to collect Argan nuts,
he gladly takes with him his herds of the above animals, that they
may eat their fill of the green husks whilst he and his family are
collecting and shelling the nuts. The horse, the ass, and the mule,
on the contrary, do not like this food. When a sufficient quantity
of nuts are collected they are brought home, the hard wooden shell
is cracked between stones, and the inner white kernels are
carefully extracted. These are roasted or burnt like coffee on
earthen, stone, or iron plates; in order that they may not be too
much done, they are constantly stirred with a stick. When properly
roasted they should be all over of a brown colour, but not charred
on the outside. The smoke, which is disengaged during the process,
has a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span>
agreeable odour. As soon as the kernels have cooled, they are
ground in a handmill into a thick meal, not unlike that of pounded
almonds, only that it is of a brown colour, and the meal is put
into a vessel in which the oil is separated, which is done by
sprinkling the mass now and then with hot water, and keeping it
constantly stirred and kneaded with the hand. This process is
carried on until the mass becomes so hard that it can no longer be
kneaded: the harder and firmer are the residuary coarse parts, the
more completely is the oil extracted. At the last, cold water is
sprinkled upon it, in order, as they say, to expel the last
particles of the oil. During the operation the oil runs out at the
sides, and is from time to time poured into a clean vessel. The
main point to be attended to in order to extract the greatest
quantity and the best quality of oil, is that it should be well
kneaded, and that the proper proportion of hot water for the
extraction of the oil should be used; it is always safer to be
sparing of it than to be too profuse. The residuary mass, often as
hard as a stone, is of a black-brown colour, and has a disagreeable
bitter flavour. The oil itself, when it has settled, is clear, of a
light brown colour, and has a rancid smell and flavour. When it is
used without other preparations in cooking, it has a stimulating
and pungent taste which is long felt on the gums. The vapour which
arises when anything is fried in it, affects the lungs and
occasions coughing. The common people use it generally without
preparation; but in better houses it is the custom, in order to
take off that pungency, to mix it previously with water, or to put
a bit of bread into it and let it simmer before the fire.</p>

<p>‘“The wood, which is hard, tough, fine-grained, and of a yellow
colour, is used in house carpentry, and for other purposes.”’</p>

<p class="space-above15">‘We have been at some pains to distribute
the seeds of this plant, with which we have been liberally
supplied, to various parts of the East Indies, and to such of our
Colonies as appeared suited to the growth of this tree, in respect
of climate, &amp;c. It is impossible for seeds to be in better
condition; and though the surrounding hard portion of the nut is as
thick and solid as that of hickory, those which we ourselves sowed
sprouted in less than a month from the time they were put
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span> the ground. The
young trees bore the rough treatment of the voyage in midwinter
remarkably well; and it is easy to see that this is a plant of
ready culture in favourable climates.</p>

<p>‘The value of the husks of the fruit as food for cattle, and the
uses of the wood, are mentioned in the above extracts. The nature
of the oil seems only to have been considered in relation to olive
oil. But vegetable oils are now so much in demand, especially by
Messrs. Price & Co., for their great candle-works at Vauxhall, as
well as at Birkenhead, near Liverpool, that I was anxious to know
the opinion of Mr. G. F. Wilson, the scientific director of those
vast establishments, on the nature of Argan oil. Some seeds were
consequently communicated to that gentleman, and he lost no time in
experimenting upon them, and assuring me that “they contain a large
percentage of a very fine oil. We have tried it in several ways, in
each case with a favourable result. Some is now being exposed to a
severe test, to show how the air acts upon it: I have, however,
little fear but that it will answer. Our city friends are inquiring
for us the best means of getting a ton or two of the nuts for
experiments on a large scale. The only unfavourable point I see is
the small weight of kernel to that of hard shell:—</p>

<table class="tdl" id="t401">
<tr>
<td>6 Nuts gave</td>
<td>—</td>
<td>kernel 30 grains</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdc word-spaced2em">„ „</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdc word-spaced2em">„ „</td>
<td>
</td>
<td>outer husk 193 grains.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p class="nind">The hard shell probably should be sent home with
the seed when the kernels are required to yield a sweet oil; for
unless prepared with great care, hardly to be expected in a wild
country, the oil would not be nearly so sweet if sent home
expressed, instead of in its kernel and shell. Perhaps if the
kernel is pounded and rammed tightly into casks, we might obtain
sweet oil without great waste in freight.”</p>

<p>‘In a botanical point of view this plant is scarcely of less
interest than in an economical. It has had the hard fate, often the
consequence of being with difficulty procured, to be much
misunderstood, and, except by Schousboe, to be imperfectly
described; and references are given in works to plants as being
identical which have no relationship with it; or to descriptions
which, if the same, exhibit little or no resemblance.</p>

<p>‘The first botanist who appears to have noticed this plant
is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span> Linnæus, who, in
the <i>Hortus Cliffortianus</i>, in 1737, described it, from dried
specimens, under the name of <i>Sideroxylon spinosum</i>. “From
Clifford’s Herbarium,” observes Mr. Dryander, “now in the
possession of Sir Joseph Banks, the Argan was taken up by Linné in
his <i>Hortus Cliffortianus</i>; though most of the synonyms are
wrong, and consequently the <i>locus natalis</i> (<i>utraque
India</i>) which is deduced from them. The specimen in Linné’s
Herbarium, under the name of <i>Sideroxylon spinosum</i>, is
without flowers, and it is impossible to tell you with any
certainty what it is. Clifford’s Herbarium is therefore the only
authority by which this species can be ascertained.” Linnæus’s
<i>Rhamnus siculus</i>, in the Appendix to the third volume of the
twelfth edition of the <i>Systema Naturæ</i>, is, we are assured by
Mr. Dryander, “the Argan, or Olive-tree of Marocco (see Höst’s
‘Efterretninger om Marokos,’ p. 284), as appears from the specimen
in Linné’s Herbarium, which has a ticket affixed, with the name of
Argan of Marocco, and which I have also compared with specimens in
Sir Joseph Banks’s Herbarium from Marocco.” The description, too,
of Linnæus is very correct. He errs only in considering the plant
to be the same as the <i>Rhamnus Siculus pentaphyllos</i> of
Boccone (<i>Rhus pentaphyllum</i>, Desf.), which has <i>folia
quinata</i>, which latter he introduces into the specific
character, but not into the description; and he erroneously
followed Boccone in giving Sicily as the native country in addition
to Africa, and in adopting the specific name <i>Siculus</i>.</p>

<p>‘In the <i>Species Plantarum</i> of Linnæus, Malabar alone is
mentioned as the native country of the <i>Sideroxylon spinosum</i>.
Nevertheless, with the exception of Willdenow, who rejects it
altogether as “planta valde dubia, forte nullibi obvia,” most of
the older authors adopt this name for the Argan of Marocco. Under
it, it appears in the first edition of <i>Hortus Kewensis</i>, with
the reference to <i>Species Plantarum</i> of Linnæus, and to
Commelyn, <i>Hortus Amstelod</i>. tab. 83, where, however, nothing
is said of its native country, further than may be surmised by the
name adopted from Breynius’s “Lycio similis frutex Indicus
spinosus, Buxi folio” (which, as already observed, Willdenow
considered to be his <i>Flacourtia sepiaria</i>, from India), and
of which the flowers and fruit were unknown to the author. If this
were the Argan, it was in cultivation in Holland as early as 1697.
At a period not much later, viz. in 1711, according<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span> to the <i>Hortus Kewensis</i>,
it was introduced into England: “Cult. 1711, by the Duchess of
Beaufort, Br. Mus. H.S. 141, fol. 39.” It is indicated as a
stove-plant.</p>

<p>‘Sir James Smith, article <i>Sideroxylon spinosum</i> in Rees’s
“Cyclopædia” (1819), throws no new light upon the subject; he omits
the reference to Commelyn. Retz, in “Obs. Bot.” vol. vi. p. 26,
refers the plant to <i>Elæodendron</i>, in which he is followed by
Willdenow, and by Schousboe, which latter author has given by far
the fullest and best account of the plant botanically and
economically.</p>

<p>‘M. Corréa de Serra, “Annales du Museum d’Histoire Naturelle,”
1809, tom. viii. p. 393, tab. v. f. l., has published a very good
analysis of the fruit, with very brief characters and no
observations. At length Mr. Brown, “Botanicorum facile princeps,”
in his invaluable Prodromus, under his Observations on Sapoteæ,
says, “<i>Sideroxylon spinosum</i>, L., fructu valde diversum
proprium hujus ordinis genus efficit;” and, acting upon his
suggestion, Rœmer and Schultes, “Systema Vegetabilium,” vol. iv.
pp. xlvi. and 502, have formed of this plant a new genus,
<i>Argania</i>, in which they have been followed by Endlicher and
Alphonse De Candolle. In this latter work a very full generic
character is given, which need not here be repeated.’</p>

<p>‘It is singular that no further allusion to this tree should
appear in Jackson’s “Account of the Empire of Marocco” than the
following: “Oil Arganic is also in abundance in Suse; it is much
used for frying fish and burning-lamps. When used for frying fish,
a quart of it should be boiled with a large onion cut in quarters;
and when it boils, a piece of the inside of a loaf, about the size
of an orange, should be put in; after which it should be taken off
the fire and let stand to cool, and when quite cold should be
strained through a sieve; without this precaution it is supposed to
possess qualities which promote leprosy.”—Dr. Barretta.’</p>

<p>The limited distribution of the Argan is one of its most
noticeable features, for as a genus it is not far removed from
<i>Sideroxylon</i>, a very widely spread tropical and subtropical
genus of both hemispheres, and which reaches its northern limit in
Madeira (in the same latitude as that attained by the Argan), where
one species, <i>S. Mermulana</i>, Lowe, is found on<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span> the rocky heights of the
interior. The order is not found in the Canary Islands, but
reappears in the Cape de Verdes in a species of <i>Sapota</i>, and
is well represented in the humid regions of Western Africa. It
would thus appear that <i>Argania</i> and the Madeiran
<i>Sideroxylon</i> are two outlying representatives of a very
tropical order; and, considering the proximity of the areas they
inhabit, and their position in the extreme west of the Old World,
they are, in a Botanico-Geographical point of view, plants of a
very high interest, as evidences of a relationship between the
Floras of these areas, which must originally have been established
under very different conditions from those which now prevail.</p>

<p>The Argan was, as stated above, introduced into England in 1811,
and was long established on a south wall, but ultimately was killed
in an unusually severe winter. Numerous plants were raised, from
seed sent by Sir John Hay, by Mr. Grace, and from those brought by
myself, and the plant may be seen in the Economic-plant House at
Kew. It is of very slow growth, which has disappointed colonists
and others, to whom the fruits have been largely distributed from
Kew.</p>

<p class="center less space-below15"><em>On the Canarian Flora as
compared with the Maroccan.</em>
</p>

<p class="center less space-below15">By <span class="sc">Joseph
Dalton Hooker</span>.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">In</span> respect of their
botanical relationship to neighbouring Continents, Islands or
Archipelagos may be roughly classed under two divisions: namely,
those which are situated within a moderate distance of continents,
and whose Floras are manifestly derived from them or have had a
common origin with theirs; and those which are situated very far
from any continents, and whose Floras differ so much either from
that of the neighbouring continent or from that of those parts of
the continent that are nearest to them, that their origin is a
matter of speculation. Of the first division, the British Isles,
and probably Vancouver’s Island, in North-West America, are
conspicuous instances, their Floras being almost identical with
those of the neighbouring continents. St. Helena, the Galapagos,
Mauritius, and the Sandwich Islands are instances of the opposite
extreme, for their Floras differ widely from those of any
continents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span>Between these
extreme cases there are many intermediate ones; and there are
others of an exceptional character, as Iceland, which, though far
removed from any part of Europe, has but one flowering plant not
found on that continent (<i>Platanthera hyperborea</i>); and
Ceylon, which though it is almost united to the Peninsula of
Hindostan, yet in many respects differs greatly from that peninsula
in its Flora.</p>

<p>Amongst the exceptional cases to continental proximity being
accompanied by close botanical relationship is the Flora of the
Canarian Archipelago, which differs so greatly from that of the
northern part of its neighbouring continent, namely, from that of
Marocco,<a id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a> that it demands notice in any work treating of
the vegetation of the latter country.</p>

<p>This diversity between the Maroccan and Canarian Floras has been
pointed out in Ball’s ‘Introductory Observations to the Spicilegium
Floræ Maroccanæ,’<a id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> where it appears that whilst Marocco, out
of 1,627 species of flowering plants, contains 165 endemic plants,
it has only 15 which are confined to it and to the Canaries, or to
it and Madeira. And Ball goes on to remark (p. 301), in respect of
these few species common to both Floras: ‘I think it is safe to say
that the facts rather tend to show the accidental diffusion of a
few Macaronesian<a id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> species on the adjacent coast of Africa,
than to indicate the direct connection between the continent and
those islands within a geological period at all recent.’</p>

<p>Were this diversity due solely or chiefly to the Canaries
wanting many Maroccan plants, the inquiry would not be a pressing
one; but as to this deficiency is to be added the presence in the
Canaries of many indigenous species, and even several genera<a id=
"FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span>
which are absent in Marocco, and in Marocco the great rarity of
endemic genera, of which <i>Argania</i> only is arboreous, the
inquiry becomes a very important one, inviting a much closer study
than can here be given to it.</p>

<p>The Flora of the Canarian Archipelago, though consisting, like
the Maroccan, for the most part of Mediterranean species, yet
differs from that of Marocco, in containing many plants that may be
classed under the following categories:—</p>

<p>I. It contains many non-Maroccan plants, obviously introduced by
man, and not from Europe only, but from various parts of both the
Old and New Worlds. This will not appear surprising when it is
remembered that Teneriffe was for several centuries the Prime
Meridian of Geographers and the resort of all the European
ocean-navigators, who took their departure from it on their outward
voyages, and made for it on their homeward ones. The
<i>Alternanthera achyrantha</i>, a tropical American plant, was no
doubt imported into the Canaries, and possibly from thence
introduced into Spain (where it is now naturalised). <i>Argemone
mexicana</i> is another, and there are still other as conspicuous
examples of such foreign introductions. This maritime intercourse
can, however, only partially account for the remarkable
disproportion between the number of probably introduced plants in
the Canaries and in Marocco; and we must take into account the
isolation, barbarism, and exclusiveness of the latter country, and
the absence of any commercial intercourse between it and the
Canaries or the rest of the world.</p>

<p>In Webb and Berthelot’s ‘Phytographia Canariensis’ upwards of
fifty plants are enumerated as to which we have little doubt that
all have been introduced by man, and none of which have hitherto
been found in Marocco. The list includes many weeds of the widest
tropical and temperate distribution, as species of <i>Sida</i>,
<i>Waltheria</i>, <i>Siegesbeckia</i>, <i>Bidens</i>,
<i>Lippia</i>, <i>Physalis</i>, <i>Nicandra</i>, <i>Euphorbia</i>,
<i>Alternanthera</i>, <i>Commelyna</i>, and various
<i>Cyperaceæ</i>, and Grasses.</p>

<p>II. The Canaries contain many apparently indigenous plants,
which, though not Maroccan, are widely distributed elsewhere; these
form a large class, and the following are some of the most
prominent of them:—</p>

hereafter be found in Marocco.</p>

<p>III. They contain some quite peculiar plants which are more
closely allied to endemic species of Marocco than to those of any
other country, and may have been derived from species that
originally were transported from that country. These are but few,
and are almost confined to species of the genus <i>Monanthes</i>,
which is limited to these countries and the Cape de Verde Islands,
of Cactoid <i>Euphorbiæ</i>, of succulent <i>Sonchi</i>, and of the

<p>IV. They contain plants not found hitherto in Marocco, and which
are more closely allied to Mediterranean species than to any
others; and these form a very large class. The data for a complete
list would require a very careful comparison of the Maroccan
species with the species described in the ‘Phytographia’ and

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">[409]</span>The
disproportion between the two Floras in the case of these selected
genera is thus well shown. It is most remarkable; the number of
endemic species being in the Canaries three-fourths of the whole
and in Marocco only one-sixth; and were the peculiar genera of the
Canaries added, the disproportion would of course be increased.</p>

<p>The total number of Canarian species enumerated by Webb and
Berthelot is about 1,000, of which 367,<a id=
"FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
or more than one-third, are regarded as peculiar to the Archipelago
(a very few only of these being also Madeiran); whereas out of
1,627 Maroccan species only 165, or a little over one-tenth, are
peculiar. Future discoveries will probably not materially increase
the Maroccan proportion of peculiar species; whereas since the
publication of Webb’s ‘Phytographia’ many peculiar species
(especially of <i>Statice</i> and <i>Crassulaceæ</i>) have been
discovered in the Canaries, and but few species common to other
countries; and these additions will go far to neutralise any error
introduced into the estimate, due to the great number of new
species founded on insufficient data which the ‘Phytographia’
includes.</p>

<p>Under this head also should be included the peculiar Canarian
genera that appear to be modifications of continental ones. They
are <i>Bencomia</i>, closely allied to <i>Poterium</i>, of which
there are two species, both confined to one Island (Teneriffe); one
of these is also a native of Madeira, where only two individual
trees, a male and a female, have ever been seen! <i>Gesnouinia</i>,
allied to <i>Parietaria</i>; and <i>Canarina</i>, a monotypic genus
allied to <i>Campanula</i>, but having a baccate fruit.
<i>Bosea</i>, also a monotypic plant, is wholly unlike any known
genus, and is, in some respects, intermediate between the two very
distinct natural families—<i>Chenopodiaceæ</i> and
<i>Phytolacceæ</i>.</p>

<p>V. Many Canarian plants are representatives of Floras more
distant than those of Marocco or Western Europe, and are not found
in those countries. These form an exceedingly interesting group,
and may be classed according to countries thus:—</p>

<p><em>a. Oriental.</em>—These are chiefly Arabo-Egyptian, but some
of them extend even into Western India, and a few are
representatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span> of
tropical India. Some will no doubt yet be discovered in Marocco,
especially south of the Atlas; and it is not unreasonable to
suppose that such have crossed Africa in a subtropical latitude,
and thus reached the Canaries under conditions now operating.</p>

<p>The most remarkable are the following. The genera in capitals
have not hitherto been found in Marocco:—</p>

<p>Of the above hardly any have been found west of the Levant, or
anywhere between Egypt and the Canaries, except, possibly, in
Southern Algeria. <i>Traganum</i> must be reckoned as an African
and Oriental desert type, and will probably be found in South
Marocco; but <i>Ceropegia</i> is mainly Indian, as is
<i>Gymnosporia</i> (<i>Catha cassinoides</i>, Webb).
<i>Campylanthus</i> consists of the Canarian species, of a variety
or closely allied one in the Cape de Verde Islands, and of a third
which extends from Southern Arabia to Scinde. The nearest ally of
the <i>Apollonias</i> (<i>Phœbe barbusana</i>, Webb) is a Ceylon
tree; and <i>Visnea</i> is nearly allied to the Malayan genus
<i>Anneslea</i>. <i>Dracæna Draco</i> is the most interesting of
all in the list; for, though the genus abounds in tropical Africa,
the Canarian form, which is also a native of the mountains of the
Cape de Verde Islands, has only one near ally, the <i>D. Ombet</i>,
which is confined to Abyssinia, Southern Arabia, and the
intervening Island of Socotra.</p>

<p class="space-above15"><em>b.</em> The peculiar species
representing American types inhabiting the Canaries or Madeira, but
not found in Marocco, are in some respects even more remarkable
than the Oriental.</p>

<p>They belong to the following genera:—</p>

<p><i>Bowlesia</i><a id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> (<i>Drusa oppositifolia</i>, DC.),
<i>Clethra</i>, five species of <i>Bystropogon</i>, and
<i>Cedronella</i>. Of these <i>Bowlesia</i> is
otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span> confined
to the tropical Andes of America, one species only extending as far
north as Mexico; the Canarian species, which according to Webb is
found on rocky shaded places in Teneriffe, from the sea-level to
the wooded region, is most closely allied to a Peruvian one.
<i>Clethra</i> is a genus which extends from South Brazil to the
Northern United States, and is also found in Japan and the Malayan
Archipelago. The Macaronesian species most resembles a North
American; it is found also in Madeira. <i>Bystropogon</i> is, like
<i>Bowlesia</i>, an Andean genus, extending from Peru to Columbia.
All the Canarian species belong to a different section from the
Andean, and there is one species of the same section in Madeira.
<i>Cedronella</i> is a North American and Mexican genus, and the
Canarian species differs from all its congeners in its trisect
leaves; it is also Madeiran.</p>

<p>Of the Canarian <i>Laurineæ</i>, <i>Persea indica</i>, also a
native of Madeira and the Azores, belongs to an American section of
that large genus.</p>

<p><em>c.</em> Tropical and South African types in the Canaries. Of
these the most noticeable are two forest trees, belonging to the
large tropical genus <i>Myrsine</i>. One of these, <i>M.
excelsa</i> (<i>Heberdenia excelsa</i>, Banks) is also found in
Madeira; the other, <i>M. canariensis</i>, is confined to the
island whose name it bears. The tropical order <i>Sapotaceæ</i>, to
which <i>Argania</i> belongs, has no representative in the
Canaries, but has one in the <i>Sideroxylon Mermulana</i> of
Madeira.</p>

<p>The only almost exclusively South African genus<a id=
"FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
in the Canaries is a species of <i>Lyperia</i>, of which there are
numerous Cape of Good Hope species, and one doubtful one in the
Somali country (North-East Africa). The widely diffused Cape shrub,
<i>Myrsine africana</i>, is found in the Azores and in Abyssinia,
but not in the Canaries, Cape de Verdes, Madeira, or Marocco. The
two singular shrubs <i>Phyllis</i> and <i>Plocama</i>, consisting
each of a single species, of which the <i>Phyllis</i> is found also
in Madeira, are representatives of the <i>Anthospermeæ</i>, a very
large and conspicuously South African and Australian tribe of
<i>Rubiaceæ</i>, and of which the only Maroccan representative is
<i>Putoria</i>, a Mediterranean genus of a single species, and
which is not Canarian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>The
<i>Oreodaphne fœtens</i> of the Canaries and Maderia is now<a id=
"FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
referred to the American, Madagascar, and South African genus
<i>Ocotea</i>, and is most nearly allied to a species found in the
latter country.</p>

introduced by man into the Canaries, and the absence of
<i>Lentibularineæ</i>, <i>Ceratophylleæ</i>, <i>Alismaceæ</i>, and

suitable localities. The total absence of <i>Cupuliferæ</i> in all
the Macaronesian Archipelago is inexplicable; and of <i>Quercus</i>
especially, a genus so prominently developed in number of species
and individuals on both continents, and which further abounds in
both the Pliocene and Miocene beds of Europe.</p>

<p>There are in Marocco, out of a total of 517 genera, 202,
included under 67 orders, that have no indigenous species in the
Canaries or Madeira. Many of these, about a quarter, being North
Maroccan, <i>i.e.</i> only found in parts of Marocco farthest from
the Canaries, would not be expected to occur in those islands, were
it not that the vegetation of islands near to large continents
often most resembles that of a higher latitude on the continent
than that in which the islands are situated.</p>

<p>Although it would be out of place here to discuss all the
questions raised by this slight sketch of the peculiarities of
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span> Canarian Flora,
there are some of them which so intimately bear upon the Maroccan
as to awaken attention.</p>

<p>The wonderful development in the Canaries of endemic species
belonging for the most part to Mediterranean types, points to the
very early introduction of the parent forms of these, and the long
isolation both of the Archipelago and its separate islets. It is in
accordance with generally accepted views, to assume that the
endemic species of each genus have been derived from parent forms
originally introduced into one or more of the islets; and that as
the descendants of these species spread over the Archipelago they
were exposed to different conditions in each islet, resulting in
their varying, and in the segregation and conservation of different
local varieties each in its own insular birth-place; a supposition
which is in accordance with the fact that those endemic species are
really very local, many being confined to a single islet. In
Marocco the parent forms of its Flora would be exposed to no such
diverse conditions, and the areas in which varieties occurred, not
being isolated, would be exposed both to invasion on all sides by
other plants, and to destruction by agencies that affected the
whole surrounding country, as drought, floods, insects, and
birds.</p>

<p>The tropical types in the Canaries, with the exception of the
Egypto-Arabian and the trees mentioned under V. <em>c.</em>, are
chiefly weeds of wide distribution, which have not reached Marocco,
because of its want of ports and its limited commerce.</p>

<p>Finally the <i>Dracæna</i>, together with the tropical trees of
<i>Myrsineæ</i>, <i>Sapotaceæ</i> (in Madeira), and
<i>Laurineæ</i>, and the Egypto-Arabian types, suggest the
hypothesis that at a very remote period these and many other plants
of warmer and damper regions flourished in the area included in
North-West Africa and its adjacent islands, and that they have been
expelled from the continent by altered conditions of climate, but
have been preserved in the more equable climate and more protected
area of the Atlantic Islands.</p>

<p>Ball, who has given me valuable aid on many points discussed in
this article, directs my attention to the important differences
that exist between the vegetation of the eastern group of the
Canary Islands—Fuertaventura, Lanzarote, and the adjacent
islets—the ‘Purpurariæ’ of authors, and the western group,
including Teneriffe, Grand Canary, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>In the first
place, nearly all the characteristic Canarian types are absent in
the eastern group. Out of fifty-four genera above enumerated as
present in the Canaries but wanting in Marocco, two are in the
Canaries confined to the eastern islands: one of these,
<i>Traganum</i>, is an African desert type, probably to be found in
South Marocco; the other, <i>Melianthus</i>, a Southern African
plant, and scarcely indigenous. Of the remainder <i>Plocama</i>
alone is certainly present, and three other generic types probably
exist in that group; while forty-eight genera, including eight out
of nine peculiar to the Canaries, are apparently absent. In the
next place several characteristic desert plants, such as
<i>Oligomeris subulata</i>, <i>Ononis vaginalis</i>, <i>Convolvulus
Hystrix</i>, and <i>Traganum nudatum</i>, are present in the
‘Purpurariæ,’ but absent from the western islands.</p>

<p>Although the Flora of the Purpurariæ is incompletely known, and
our acquaintance with that of the neighbouring African coast
between the rivers Sous and Draha is extremely imperfect, these
facts tend to prove that there is a closer botanical relationship
between the eastern islands and the adjoining continent than there
is between them and the western portion of the Canarian
Archipelago. Such relationship might be brought about in three
different ways.</p>

<p>1. The greater dryness and heat of the eastern islands may have
favoured the immigration of African forms, and at the same time led
to the destruction, or weeding out, of the characteristic Canarian
types. In this case the cause would be of a purely local and
climatic character.</p>

<p>2. We may believe in the trans-oceanic migration of some African
species to the nearer islands, along with the transport of some
Canarian species (those enumerated in <a href="#Page_416" class=
"pginternal">p. 416</a>, and others which may be hereafter found)
to the neighbouring continent.</p>

<p>3. An ancient extension of the continent to the Purpurariæ,
leaving the other islands separated by deep sea.</p>

<p>It is an objection to the latter hypothesis that a profoundly
deep ocean bed lies between the lines of 100 fathom soundings that
girdle the islands and the African coast respectively; and that
while the 100 fathom line extends about thirty miles from the coast
of the continent, it is never more than five miles, rarely more
than one or two, from those of the islands.</p>

<p>In favour of the hypothesis of trans-oceanic transport it may be
remarked that the distance between the African coast
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">[419]</span> Fuertaventura
is not more than seventy miles, and that a moderate change of level
of about 600 feet would reduce that distance by one-half, while it
would but slightly affect the interval that separates the
Purpurariæ from the other islands.</p>

<p>Among the possible causes leading to an interchange of species
between the Purpurariæ and the African coast the agency of man must
not be omitted. The fishermen of those islands were formerly in the
habit of visiting some points on the opposite coast, although
intercourse of this kind has almost ceased in recent times.</p>

<p>It must be observed that our knowledge of the vegetation of the
Canary Islands is yet incomplete. Although several additions to the
Flora have been published by C. Bolle and others, no supplement to
Webb’s ‘Phytographia’ has been published. Several additional
species exist in herbaria, besides those that may be hereafter
found.</p>

<p>So little is known of the geology of Marocco, that there are no
data for ascertaining whether during antecedent geological periods
it contained a more tropical Flora than now; but evidence in
support of such a hypothesis is forthcoming in Madeira, where
fossiliferous beds which have been referred to ‘some part of the
Pliocene period’<a id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72"
class="fnanchor">[14]</a> have been discovered, containing leaves
referable in part to existing species of Madeiran plants, and in
part to extinct ones of tropical aspect;<a id=
"FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and it is well ascertained that during preceding geological periods
Western Europe was clothed with a vegetation that suggests a very
much warmer climate than now prevails, and of which vegetation the
<i>Laurus nobilis</i> in the south-west of the continent has been
supposed to be a surviving representative.</p>

<p>In Grand Canary, also, Upper Miocene beds exist, containing
numerous species of fossil shells, of which one is an Oregon
species, and another tropical African; and in more recent deposits
of the same Archipelago many shells have been found which no longer
inhabit the adjacent seas, including tropical West African,
Mozambique, and Mediterranean species.</p>

<p>We can form no conception of means of transport from the
American continent that would transfer the parent species of
<i>Bowlesia</i> and of the <i>Bystropogons</i> from the Andes to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">[420]</span> Atlantic
islands; and we can but hazard the assumption that, at some very
distant date, these genera existed in more eastern parts of
America, from whence seeds were transported across the ocean. On
the other hand, the transport of parent forms or existing species
from the continents of Europe and Africa to the Atlantic islands
may have been much facilitated by greater extensions of land in
bygone ages. Madeira, the Canaries, and the Cape de Verde Islands,
are all supposed to stand on a submarine platform which skirts the
coasts of Western Europe and North-Western Africa, and whose
submerged margin immediately to the westward of the position of the
islands descends rapidly to a profound depth. The westward margin
of this platform was possibly the coast-line in Miocene times. An
elevation of its surface of a few hundred feet would approximate
the islands to the mainland very materially, and greatly facilitate
transport. That they were, however, ever united to the continent is
opposed to the views of most competent geologists. Lyell, speaking
of this, says: ‘The general abruptness of the cliffs of all the
Atlantic islands, coupled with the rapid deepening of the sea
outside the 100 fathom line, are characters which favour the
opinion that each island was formed separately by igneous
eruptions, and in a sea of great depth.’ Moreover, the Azores,
whose botany in so many respects resembles that of the other
Atlantic islands, as distinguished from that of the continent, are
enormously more distant from the mainland; and these islands stand
on a platform of their own, separated from the continental one by
an ocean of profound depth; so that any theory of transport which
applies to the Canarian and Madeiran Archipelagos, should apply
also to the Azorean.</p>

<p>It remains a point of some nicety to decide whether the
Macaronesian islands should be regarded as a Botanical province
apart from the Mediterranean, or a sub-division of the latter. The
assemblage of American and Oriental genera which their Flora
contains, together with the arboreous representatives of tropical
<i>Laurineæ</i>, all so entirely foreign to the European Flora,
would give it a title to be called a Botanical province; and to
this as a further title is the prevalence of a considerable
proportion of North European plants, in the Northern Archipelago
especially. On the other hand, fully two-thirds of the species are
typical of the Mediterranean Flora, and by far the majority of the
remainder are derivative species of the same<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_421">[421]</span> origin; so that, on the whole, I am
disposed to regard it as a very distinct sub-division of the
Mediterranean province, which owes its peculiarities partly to the
conservation of types once common to West Europe and North Africa,
but which have been eliminated in those regions, and partly to the
effect of isolation and climate on the progeny of species still
existing in those regions.</p>

Azores, and perhaps also of the Cape de Verde Islands, which
together form either a distinct botanical province, or a marked
subdivision of the Mediterranean province.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">As</span> was to have been
anticipated, the Maroccan Flora contains most of the European
species which have been collected on the mountains of Abyssinia and
of the Bight of Biafra, which alone of the tropical African Alps
have been botanically explored. Of these the former have been
visited by Schimper and various collectors; whilst the mountains of
the pestilential West African coast, of Fernando Po, 9,500 feet,
and the Cameroons Mountains, upwards of 13,000 feet, have been
ascended for botanical purposes only by Gustav Mann, when employed
for the Royal Gardens of Kew.</p>

<p>The results of the latter were published by myself in the
‘Journal of the Linnæan Society of London’ (vol. vii. p. 171), from
whence the following observations are for the most part extracted.
They included 26 European species, gathered at elevations between
5,000 and 10,000 feet. Most of them are also natives of the
Abyssinian Alps, and two-thirds of them are also Maroccan, whilst
others will probably yet be found in the latter country.</p>

the upper regions of the Cameroons Mountains and Fernando Po:—</p>

<p>The most remarkable features of the Temperate vegetation of
these West African tropical mountains are:—</p>

<p>1. Its poverty.</p>

<p>2. The preponderance of Abyssinian genera and species.</p>

<p>3. The considerable proportion of European plants.</p>

<p>4. The paucity of South African genera and species.</p>

<p>5. The great rarity of new genera.</p>

<p>6. The absence of St. Helena and Canarian types.</p>

<p>Upon each of these propositions I have a few general remarks to
offer.</p>

<p>In the poverty of their Flora the Cameroons range and Peak of
Fernando Po seem to partake of the characteristics of the
Abyssinian Alps. We know far too little of the physical geography
of either of these districts to hazard many conjectures upon this
point, which must to a certain extent be dependent on the arid
volcanic nature of the soil and the limited area of the Temperate
region. Mr. Mann spent many weeks, and at various seasons, in his
explorations, and yet 237 flowering plants were all that rewarded
his toil. Geological causes have probably had, in the case of the
Cameroons Mountains,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_423">[423]</span> much to do with the dearth of species, some
parts of the range even now presenting evidence of subterranean
heat.</p>

<p>The preponderance of Abyssinian forms is proved by almost all of
the genera and half the species being natives of Abyssinia, and by
many other species being very closely related to, or obvious
representatives of, plants of that country. There are, further,
several of the genera and many of the species peculiar to Abyssinia
and the peaks of Biafra.</p>

<p>The number of European genera amounts to 43, and species to 26,
the greater part of which are British. Very few of them extend into
South Africa. The greater part are Abyssinian; the remarkable
exceptions being <i>Radiola</i>, <i>Scabiosa succisa</i>, <i>Luzula
campestris</i>, and <i>Festuca gigantea</i>, all of which, however,
may have been hitherto overlooked in Abyssinia.</p>

<p>I find no other evidence of relationship between the Biafran
mountain Flora and that of Marocco than what is afforded by the
European species common to both. In most other respects the Floras
differ totally, the other mountain plants of Biafra being
Abyssinian or Cape types, or more nearly related to tropical
African ones.</p>

<p class="center less space-below15"><em>On the Mountain Flora of
Two Valleys in the Great Atlas of Marocco.</em>
</p>

<p class="center less space-below15">By <span class="sc">John
Ball</span>.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Although</span> an attempt to
discuss the character and relations of the Flora of a region so
wide and so little known as the mountain region of the Great Atlas
would as yet be quite premature, it appears that the materials at
our disposal suffice for an examination of the vegetation of the
valleys lying south and south-west of the city of Marocco, which
may be an acceptable contribution to botanical geography. For this
purpose it seems best to limit the discussion to the two valleys
where our collections were sufficiently extensive to give a
tolerably complete representation of the vegetation, as far as this
was developed at the season of our visit, and to exclude altogether
the plants found along the skirts of the great range below the
level of about 1,200 metres above the sea. The Flora of the zone
below that level is largely mixed up with extraneous<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_424">[424]</span> elements, represented by
plants of the low country that reach the base of the mountains, but
do not penetrate the interior valleys, and if these had been
admitted the special features of the mountain Flora would have
become less apparent. The plants collected in the course of a
somewhat hurried excursion from Seksaoua, when we reached a height
of about 1,600 metres, have been designedly omitted. On such
occasions attention is to a great extent monopolised by the new and
rare species not hitherto seen in the same region, while
comparatively familiar forms are less carefully noted. Collections
made under such circumstances rarely give a moderately complete
report of the vegetable population.</p>

<p>In ascending to the higher region of mountains that approach to
the limit of vegetation the absolute number of species is so much
smaller that this source of error is far less apparent; and it is
not likely that in the two ascents which we made to the dividing
ridge of the Atlas many species that came within our range of
vision were overlooked. The following tabular arrangement shows
that in the Aït Mesan valley, where we spent the greater part of
six days, we collected 375 species of phænogamous plants, to which
have been added three subsequently found there by MM. Rein and
Fritsch; while in the Amsmiz valley only 223 species—or less than
three-fifths of the above number—were collected. Of these 146
species are common to both valleys; so that our list does not in
all exceed 455 species of flowering plants, to which I have added
10 vascular cryptogams, of which two only were found in the Amsmiz
valley.</p>

<p>In the following list I distinguish a middle zone, extending
from 1,200 to 2,000 metres above the sea, and a superior zone
including all above that limit; the latter corresponding pretty
nearly with the sub-alpine and alpine zones of the higher mountains
of Europe. With reference to their distribution I have divided the
species into four categories: 1, Mid-European, those extending to
Central Europe, of which more than three-fourths belong to the
British Flora: 2, wide-spread Mediterranean, extending beyond the
bounds of the three adjoining regions, Algeria, the Spanish
peninsula, and the Canary Islands: 3, confined to adjoining
regions; that is, to one or more of those just enumerated: 4,
endemic, known only in the Great Atlas, or the neighbouring
provinces of Marocco.</p>

extent, affect the results. Although the season of our visit—the
second half of May—was probably the best as regards the middle
zone, it was too early to find the vegetation fully developed in
the superior zone, especially on the highest ridges. It is probable
that on this account the proportion of <i>Umbelliferæ</i> and
<i>Gramineæ</i> found in the higher region is smaller than it would
have been at a later season. At first sight it would appear that
the shorter time that we were able to devote to an examination of
the upper region, and the snow-storm which we encountered in the
ascent to the Tagherot Pass, make the proportion of species found
there, as shown by our lists, unduly small. There can be no doubt
that we must have lost several species owing to these causes, but
not enough to vitiate the results to a serious extent. In
confirmation of this opinion it may be mentioned that although a
native employed by M. Cosson has since made a large collection in
the same part of the Great Atlas, and two German naturalists—MM.
Rein and Fritsch—have visited the head of the Aït Mesan valley,
very few species have been added to the Flora of the higher
mountain region.</p>

<p>The first conclusion that strikes a botanist on examining the
foregoing list is that the general type of the vegetation clearly
marks this as belonging to the great Mediterranean Flora,
which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">[436]</span> extends, with
local peculiarities, from Persia and Belutschistan to the Atlantic
Islands. Out of 248 genera represented in the Flora of these
valleys there is not one which is not common to other portions of
the Mediterranean region, and one only (<i>Monanthes</i>) is
confined to the Great Atlas and the Canary and Cape de Verde
Islands, all the others being types more or less widely spread.
Further than this, the proportion borne by each of the prevailing
natural orders to the whole vegetable population is pretty nearly
the same that we are accustomed to find in the mountain regions of
the Mediterranean region.</p>

<p>The materials for a comparison are unfortunately yet incomplete
as regards many of the mountain districts which are best fitted for
the purpose. The Flora of the Lesser Atlas of Algeria, as well as
that of the rest of the French possessions in Africa, will be fully
known only on the appearance of the important work promised by M.
Cosson. The Flora of Spain by MM. Willkomm and Lange is yet
unfinished, and there is the further difficulty that those authors
have admitted a large number of plants to the rank of species which
many botanists reckon only as varieties. M. Boissier’s great work,
the ‘Flora Orientalis,’ is also unfinished, and no adequate
materials exist for compiling lists of the plants of the Greek
mountains, of those of Asia Minor, or of the Lebanon chain, all of
which would afford interesting materials for comparison. In the
following table I have taken for comparison the Flora of the Sierra
Nevada, with the neighbouring mountains of the ancient kingdom of
Granada above the level of about 800 metres, compiled from
Boissier’s ‘Voyage botanique dans le Midi de l’Espagne;’ that of
the Bulgardagh (the principal group of the Cilician Taurus), from a
list published by M. Pierre de Tchihatcheff in the ‘Bulletin of the
French Botanical Society;’ that of Dalmatia, from Visiani’s
excellent ‘Flora Dalmatica;’ and that of the southern slopes of the
chain of the Alps from Nice to the Karst, formed by myself from all
available sources.</p>

<p>In the same table I have introduced, for the purpose of further
comparison, separate columns for the middle and superior regions of
the Great Atlas valleys, and in connection with the last I have
added in a separate column the results for the higher zone of the
Sierra Nevada. Under each heading I have stated</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">[438]</span>the
whole number of phanerogamous species included in the Flora of the
region, and opposite the name of each natural order I have entered
the number of species found in each region, and the percentage
proportion which this number bears to the entire flora. Besides the
orders which bear the largest proportion in the Great Atlas Flora I
have enumerated those that usually characterise the vegetation of
high mountains in this part of the world, though several of these
are little, or not at all, represented in the Flora of the Great
Atlas.</p>

<p>Confining the comparison in the first instance to the figures
given for the Atlas Flora as a whole in the first column, and those
given in the fourth, sixth, seventh, and eighth columns
respectively, for the Sierra Nevada, the Bulgardagh, Dalmatia, and
the southern side of the Alps, we remark in the first place that
<i>Monocotyledons</i> bear about the same proportion to
<i>Dicotyledons</i> in the Great Atlas that they do in the Sierra
Nevada, the percentage here being much larger than it is in the
Bulgardagh, and considerably less than in Dalmatia or the Southern
Alps. In this part of the world this percentage in the Flora of a
given region mainly depends upon the number of <i>Gramineæ</i> and
<i>Cyperaceæ</i>. The abundance of the latter group in the Alps
doubtless arises from the fact that at a former period physical
conditions favoured the migration of a large number of northern
species that have been unable to extend to the more southern
mountain regions of the Mediterranean area.</p>

<p>In all the regions under consideration we find, with a single
exception, that the same eight natural orders take precedence of
all others as regards the number of species that they exhibit, the
aggregate in every case exceeding one-half of the whole
phanerogamous Flora. These natural orders are <i>Compositæ</i>,
<i>Leguminosæ</i>, <i>Gramineæ</i>, <i>Caryophylleæ</i>,
<i>Cruciferæ</i>, <i>Labiatæ</i>, <i>Scrophularineæ</i>, and
<i>Umbelliferæ</i>. The exception arises from the prevalence,
already noticed, of <i>Cyperaceceæ</i> in the Flora of the Southern
Alps. In comparing the figures in the Great Atlas column with those
for the other areas above enumerated, it is well to recollect that
our materials are taken from a district much more limited in extent
than the others, and are necessarily imperfect, because obtained
from a single short visit to each valley at a season when many
species are yet undeveloped. It is probable, for instance, that the
proportion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">[439]</span>
<i>Umbelliferæ</i> would be increased if the whole Flora were
better known. Subject to this remark, it will be seen, as might be
expected, that the constituents of the Great Atlas Flora show more
analogy with those of the Sierra Nevada and Bulgardagh Floras than
with those of Dalmatia and the Southern Alps; but the proportion of
<i>Compositæ</i> is larger than in any of them (nearly 14 per
cent). In comparing the vegetation of a small district with that of
a large one it must be recollected that a small natural group
containing a few widely spread species, such as <i>Geraniaceæ</i>,
is likely to show a larger percentage proportion to the whole Flora
in the small district than in the larger one. It may happen that
the same species are spread through both regions; but in one case
the number is to be compared with a small total, in the other with
a much larger one. This remark has a bearing on the fact that in
the Great Atlas Flora the natural orders that bear an unusually
large proportion to the total number of the Flora are
<i>Leguminosæ</i>, <i>Caryophylleæ</i>, <i>Rubiaceceæ</i>,
<i>Papaveraceæ</i>, <i>Geraniaceæ</i>, and <i>Convolvulaceæ</i>. On
the other hand, there is a remarkable deficiency in the natural
orders that especially characterise the Flora of the Alps, and in a
less degree, the high mountains of Southern Europe. These are
<i>Ranunculaceceæ</i>, <i>Rosaceæ</i>, <i>Saxifrageæ</i>,
<i>Primulaceæ</i>, <i>Junceæ</i>, and <i>Cyperaceæ</i>; not to
speak of <i>Gentianeæ</i>, which are here altogether absent.</p>

<p>If, instead of regarding the Atlas Flora as a whole, we examine
separately the figures given in the several columns for the middle
and superior zones respectively, we find very different proportions
for the chief natural orders, except for <i>Compositæ</i> and
<i>Leguminosæ</i> which are in both very numerous. In the middle
region of the Atlas these two orders represent very nearly
one-fourth of the phænogamous Flora. After these <i>Gramineæ</i>,
<i>Rubiaceæ</i>, <i>Papaveraceæ</i>, <i>Geraniaceæ</i>,
<i>Cistineæ</i>, and <i>Convolvulaceæ</i> are, in the middle
region, unusually frequent, while <i>Cruciferæ</i>, <i>Rosaceæ</i>,
<i>Boragineæ</i>, and <i>Liliaceæ</i> are remarkably deficient. In
the superior zone, on the other hand, the proportion of
<i>Compositæ</i> and <i>Leguminosæ</i> is less excessive, making
jointly a little over one-fifth of the whole Flora of the upper
region. The most marked characteristic here is the very large
proportion of <i>Cruciferæ</i>, being less by one species only than
the number of <i>Compositæ</i>. Taking into account the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_440">[440]</span> number of individuals as well
as that of species, this must be regarded as the dominant element
in the Flora of the higher region of the Great Atlas, affording as
it does 12 per cent of the whole Flora. The only region in which
this characteristic is approached is the Bulgardagh in Cilicia,
where <i>Cruciferæ</i> supply near one-tenth of the whole list.
<i>Caryophylleæ</i> also form an unusually large element in the
Flora of the upper zone of the Atlas; but, unlike <i>Cruciferæ</i>,
this order exhibits no endemic species, and four-fifths of the
whole number are common plants of Central and Northern Europe.
<i>Rubiaceæ</i> and <i>Boragineæ</i> have more representative
species than is usual in mountain Floras; while there are but three
species of <i>Rosaceæ</i> in our list; and <i>Campanulaceæ</i>,
<i>Primulaceæ</i>, <i>Coniferæ</i>, and <i>Cyperaceæ</i> are each
represented by a single species, and <i>Gentianeæ</i> and
<i>Junceæ</i> are altogether absent from the higher zone.</p>

<p>Although statistical results, such as those given above, are not
without interest, as throwing light upon the general
characteristics of the Flora of a given region, any rational
grounds for speculation as to the real affinities and past history
of the vegetation must be derived from a closer examination of the
individual species of which it is constituted. It is at least
conceivable that two Floras should exhibit similar proportions of
species belonging to the several natural groups, with no identical
species, and with little or no indication of community of origin.
The particulars given in our general list will have already led the
reader to infer that the results of an examination into the
distribution of the individual species that go to make up the Great
Atlas exhibit some very peculiar features. Taking the totals at the
foot of our list, and excluding cryptogams, it is seen that more
than one-third of the species are plants of Middle and Northern
Europe, while about one-sixth is made up of endemic species
peculiar to Marocco, and, with few exceptions, not known out of the
Great Atlas, more than half of the whole list belonging to one or
other of these categories. The results, as shown in the following
table, are still more remarkable when we separately examine the
zones into which mountain vegetation is naturally divided. As in
the former table the figures first entered in each column represent
the number of species belonging to each category, those next given
showing the percentage proportion borne by that number to the total
proportion of each region.</p>

<p>From this table we see that while over one-third of the whole
Atlas Flora consists of plants of Central and Northern Europe, the
proportion reaches nearly to one-half in the higher region (above
2,000 metres); and also that the proportion of endemic species,
which in the aggregate is one-sixth of the whole, rises to
one-fifth in the upper zone. On the other hand, the proportion of
purely Mediterranean species, which amounts to 55 per cent. in the
Flora of the middle zone, falls below 36<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_442">[442]</span> per cent. in the upper region. Of these
Mediterranean species the large majority (more than two-thirds) are
widely distributed plants, several of them extending to the
mountains of Asia Minor, and twenty species only are exclusively
confined to the Great Atlas and to the mountains of Southern Spain,
the Lesser Atlas, or the Pyrenees. There is nothing in the
distribution of these latter plants to indicate any special
connection between the Atlas and any one of the mountain regions
above mentioned. Six Atlas species are common to Southern Spain and
the Algerian Atlas, six more are known only on the mountains of
Southern Spain, five have been hitherto supposed to be peculiar to
the Lesser Atlas, and three are elsewhere confined to the
Pyrenees.</p>

<p>Some further light may be thrown on the origin of the Great
Atlas Flora by considering the affinities of the plants which are
reckoned in our list as endemic in Marocco, nearly all being
confined, so far as we know, to the chain of the Great Atlas.
Although all of these, along with some that we have classed as mere
varieties, would be counted as distinct species by many botanists,
a considerable number, amounting to more than a quarter of the
whole, are, according to the views expressed elsewhere by the
writer,<a id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> to be ranked as sub-species. But here again we
fail to discover indications of special relations between the Great
Atlas Flora and that of neighbouring mountain regions. Ranking as
sub-species twenty-one out of the seventy-five endemic forms
enumerated in our list, we find that ten of these are allied to
widely spread Mediterranean species, three are related to plants of
Central Europe, three to species common to Algeria and Southern
Spain, three more to species confined to the Spanish peninsula, and
two to endemic Algerian forms.</p>

<p>If we scrutinise in the same manner the endemic forms of the
higher region of the Great Atlas, we find that out of the
thirty-five enumerated eight, or less than one-fourth, are to be
ranked as sub-species. Of these, three are nearly allied to
wide-spread Mediterranean species, one to a plant common to Spain
and Algeria, two to endemic Spanish species, one to an
Algerian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">[443]</span> endemic
form, and one is related to a species indigenous in the Alps and
other high mountains of Central Europe.</p>

<p>While recognising the fact that the relations between the
vegetable population of the Great Atlas and that of the south of
Spain are less close than might have been expected on theoretical
grounds, we must yet admit that, on the whole, the Great Atlas is
more nearly connected in a botanical sense with this than with any
other mountain region that is known to us; and it becomes a matter
of some interest to compare closely the list of species obtained by
us in the Atlas, with the comparatively well known Flora of
Southern Spain. The results of this comparison are given for the
Great Atlas generally, and for the superior zone separately, in the
following table, in which the Atlas species are distinguished under
five heads: 1, those found in the higher region of the Sierra
Nevada; 2, in the mountain region of Andalusia; 3, in the lower
warm region below the level of about 2,000 feet; 4, absent from
Southern Spain, but found in the central or northern provinces; and
5, those not included in the Spanish Flora.</p>

<p>The figures given in this table are of much interest, proving,
as they do, the wide differences that exist between the Floras of
two mountain regions not widely separated from each other, and
exposed to climatal conditions not altogether dissimilar. We see
that three-sevenths of the plants found in the higher region of the
Great Atlas are absent from the South of Spain, and that the same
remark applies to considerably more than one-third of all the
plants found in the portion of the Great Atlas visited by us,
although a notable proportion (in both cases) is to be found in
Central and Northern Spain. Especially noteworthy is the fact that
many of the species thus absent in Southern Spain are plants of
Central Europe, most of which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_444">[444]</span> extend to the northern part of the Spanish
Peninsula, although some of them are altogether wanting in the
Floras of Spain and Portugal.</p>

<p>A simple inspection of our list suffices to show that it
discloses no trace of affinity between the Great Atlas Flora and
that of the Canary Islands, or, to use a term of wider geographical
import, that of Macaronesia. The few species belonging exclusively
to the latter region and to Marocco are nearly all confined to the
coast region.<a id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> Almost all the species common to the Atlas and
to Macaronesia are widely spread Mediterranean plants that ascend
from the low country into the valleys. The solitary mountain plant
belonging to this category is <i>Arabis albida</i>, the southern
form of <i>A. alpina</i>, common in the East, and in the Apennines
of Central and Southern Italy, but which, strange to say, has not
been found in Spain. In Teneriffe, as in the Atlas, it ascends to
about the level of 2,700 metres above the sea. The only fact
suggesting a remote affinity between the Great Atlas and
Macaronesian Floras is the presence in the former of a species of
<i>Monanthes</i>, a generic group hitherto found only in the Canary
and Cape de Verde Islands. But the absence of any closer connection
clearly shows that the separation between the Macaronesian group
and the main land of Africa must date from a period, even
geologically speaking, remote.</p>

<p>When we come to sum up the results of the foregoing discussion,
bearing always in mind the fact that we possess a mere fragment of
the Flora of the Great Atlas, and that future exploration may
largely modify our conclusions, we find as its most striking
characteristic the presence of a large proportion of plants of
Central and Northern Europe, along with a considerable number of
peculiar species not hitherto known elsewhere; and we observe that
these two constituents, which<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_445">[445]</span> together form about one-half of the Flora
of the region here discussed, amount to very nearly two-thirds of
the species found in the higher zone. We remark that of these
northern plants none are of Alpine or Arctic type, that nearly all
belong to what has been called the Germanic Flora, and all are
plants of the plain, not in Europe characteristic of mountain
vegetation.<a id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Of the species belonging to the Mediterranean region, which
constitute more than one-half of the vegetation of the middle zone,
and about one-third of that of the higher zone of the Atlas, the
large majority are widely diffused species. The remaining number,
for the most part mountain plants, may be divided into three nearly
equal sections, some being common both to Southern Spain and
Algeria, others to the Atlas and Southern Spain exclusively, and
others to the Great Atlas and the Lesser Atlas of Algeria. Nothing
indicates any special connection with the Floras of either of those
regions.</p>

<p>The absence of any distinct generic types from the Great Atlas
Flora has already been remarked. It is not less important to note
the absence of any of the southern types, characteristic of the
sub-tropical zone, some representatives of which are found in the
same or even in higher latitudes, in Arabia, Syria, Persia, and
Northern India, and which also appear in the Canary Islands. We
finally are led to regard the mountain Flora of Marocco as a
southern extension of the European temperate Flora, with little or
no admixture of extraneous elements, but so long isolated from the
neighbouring regions, that a considerable number of new specific
types have here been developed. The physical causes which have
operated to bring about these conditions are doubtless numerous and
complicated, but the most important of them are easily indicated.
The influence of the Atlantic climate, and the prevailing direction
of the aërial and oceanic currents, have fitted this region for the
habitation of such northern species as do not require a long period
of winter repose. In the present condition of the African
continent, the Great Desert, extending for a distance of 700 or 800
miles between the Atlas and the river region of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_446">[446]</span> tropical Africa, effectually
prevents the northward extension of most forms of animal and
vegetable life; while in a period geologically recent, it is most
probable that the same area was occupied by a wide gulf, which
served the same purpose of barring the migration of southern
forms.</p>

<p>It may be premature to attempt to trace in further detail the
origin of the Great Atlas Flora; but the facts already ascertained
certainly authorise some negative inferences. The absence of plants
of Arctic type proves that if some mountains of Southern Europe
received contributions to their vegetation during the glacial
period by means of floating ice-rafts, that mode of diffusion did
not extend to the Great Atlas. If we suppose that during the
glacial period the temperature of the region north of the Atlas had
fallen so low as to permit the migration of northern species across
the intervening low country, we find it difficult to understand why
so many species which, according to this theory, must have
retreated to the Atlas on the subsequent rise of temperature,
should have failed also to find a refuge in the mountains of
Southern Spain.</p>

<p>It is a further difficulty that if the constituents of the Great
Atlas Flora had, to a large extent, travelled by the route here
indicated, other species, now inhabiting the mountains of Southern
Spain, could scarcely fail to take the same road, and a much nearer
connection than is now apparent would have been established between
the Floras of these two mountain regions.</p>

<p>It is, at least, possible that the wide diffusion of many of the
species constituting the so-called Germanic Flora may date from a
period much more remote than is ordinarily supposed; and it is a
circumstance not without significance that so many species of this
type prove themselves capable of tolerating wide variations in
conditions of soil and climate.</p>

<p>Barbary, with the exception of the immediate neighbourhood of a
few of the ports, has been almost inaccessible to Europeans; and
the extreme jealousy of the Moorish Government with reference to
the mineral riches of the country has hitherto prevented any
geological investigation. In the year 1869 I visited the northern
portion of Marocco, including the Tangier and Tetuan promontory,
and during the spring of 1871 accompanied Dr. Hooker and Mr. Ball
to Mogador, the city of Marocco and the Great Atlas, permission for
our visit having been obtained from the late Sultan through
representations made to the Moorish Government by Lord Granville
through Sir John D. Hay, our Minister Plenipotentiary at
Tangier.</p>

<p>The object of the second journey was mainly botanical; and as an
engagement was given by Dr. Hooker that we should not collect
minerals, the opportunities for geological investigation were very
limited.</p>

<p>The observations I was able to make on the structure of the
great chain, which had not been previously ascended by a European,
and of the plain of Marocco, are embodied in the accompanying
section. Stopping for about a fortnight at Tangier, we made several
excursions in the neighbourhood. The western part of the northern
promontory of Marocco, facing the Straits of Gibraltar, consists of
highly-contorted beds<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_448">[448]</span> of hard courses interstratified with
brindled yellowish sandstones and variegated puce and grey marls,
having a general dip to the south-east, but so twisted about that
the dip and strike are often reversed within a few feet. The
country has a general undulating contour, here and there rising up
into ridges of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, in which the hard bands
weathered out from the softer strata are strikingly prominent from
a great distance.</p>

<p>We observed no palæontological evidence of their age; but,
judging from their resemblance to the cliff-sections near Saffi,
where fossils occur, they are presumably Neocomian or
Cretaceous.</p>

<p>Fucoids were collected by M. Coquand in the vicinity of Tangier,
in beds considered by him to be representatives of the Upper Chalk;
but M. Mourlon, referring to the works of Pareto and Studer on the
nummulitic rocks of the Northern Apennines and Switzerland,
inclines to place the Tangier fucoid beds above the nummulitic
horizon, and as part of the Upper Eocene. But near the villages of
Souani and Meharain, a little to the south of Tangier, undoubted
Cretaceous fossils were met with by M. Desquin, including</p>

<div class="container width20 space-below15">
<ul class="simple">
<li><i>Inoceramus</i>,</li>

<li><i>Ostrea Nicaisei</i>,</li>

<li><i>Globiconcha ponderosa</i> (?),</li>

<li><i>Trigonia</i> (casts), and</li>

<li><i>Echinodermata</i> (undeterminable);</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="nind">and M. Mourlon concludes that the Tangier
promontory consists of Eocene beds resting on Cretaceous.</p>

<p>The eastern half of the northern promontory, including Tetuan
and Apes’ Hill facing Gibraltar, consists of beds of a different
character, for the most part of a hard metamorphic limestone, in
which dip and strike are very obscure: these may be a southern
extension of the Gibraltar limestone; but I had no opportunity of
tracing the connection to Tetuan.</p>

<p>The late James Smith, of Jordan Hill (in ‘Journal of Geological
Society,’ vol. ii. p. 41), mentions the occurrence of casts of
<i>Terebratula fimbriata</i> and <i>T. concinna</i>, belonging to
the Lower Oolite, in the Gibraltar limestone. M. Coquand also
assigns to the Jurassic period the beds in the neighbourhood of
Tetuan, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">[449]</span> divides
them into four stages, characterised respectively by marls,
dolomites, a calcareous sandstone with the odour of petroleum, and
a lithographic limestone containing siliceous concretions. I am of
opinion that the Tetuan series, ranging with the Gibraltar
limestone, and probably extending far to the south, is separated
from the more recent Cretaceous series to the west and north-west
by a great north and south fault, which divides nearly equally the
Tangier promontory. M. Mourlon, referring to some specimens of
shelly limestone in the Brussels Museum, collected near the river
Mhellah in the district of Ouled Eissa, between Fez and Tetuan,
resembling the Muschelkalk in aspect, and associated with beds
resembling those at Tetuan, considers that they may also be of
Jurassic age.</p>

<p>The Tetuan limestone has given rise to enormous beds of
brecciated tufa, on terraces of which the city is built. The flow
seems to have taken place from the hills to the north-west of the
city, and has produced beds of a collective thickness of 60 or 70
feet. This is evidently true tufa, due to aqueous deposition, and
is of a different character from the great calcareous sheet, to
which I shall have occasion further to refer, which shrouds over
the entire plain of Marocco.</p>

<p>Respecting the Mediterranean coast-line of Barbary, I will not
add much to a paper read before the British Association at
Liverpool, in which I remarked on the singular absence of
coast-cliffs of any height. The undulating contour of the
land-surface extends down to the water’s edge, a continuation of
the form of the bottom of the straits without the intervention of
cliff-escarpments, from which I surmised that the present sea-level
and coast-line of the straits had not been of long duration.</p>

<p>Of frequent changes of level on the Barbary coast there is
abundant evidence. The more recent seem to be, first, an elevation
of from 60 to 70 feet along the entire coast, implied by the
existence of concrete sand-cliffs with recent shells exactly
similar to the raised beaches of Devon and Cornwall. These occur in
Tangier Bay to a height of 40 feet, resting on the upturned edges
of nearly vertical mesozoic beds; to the south of Cape Spartel, as
a long cliff nearly 50 feet high; as low shoals near Casa Blanca;
as a compact cliff about 50 feet high at Saffi, and as a
coast-cliff and islands at Mogador, where the concrete sand-beds
attain a height of 60 or 70 feet above the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_450">[450]</span> sea-level. It seems probable that this
elevation of coast-line was coincident with a similar rise, implied
by the existence of concrete sand-cliffs, all along the Spanish and
Portuguese coasts, viz. on the eastern face of Gibraltar, where
stratified raised beaches are seen cropping up at a considerable
height from under the great mass of drift-sand in Catalan Bay; at
Cadiz, as low cliffs 40 to 50 feet high, forming a hard coarse
freestone of which the city is built; and also at the Rock of
Lisbon, where, at a height of from 150 to 180 feet, isolated
fragments of stratified concrete sandstone are seen clinging to the
sea-escarpment of the older rocks.</p>

<p>The great range of latitude included in this simultaneous
coast-rise suggests the probability that the elevation of similar
coast-beds in Devon and Cornwall may pertain to the same
movement.</p>

<p>Judging from the evidence afforded by the coast near Mogador, a
subsequent submergence appears to be taking place. The island is
probably diminishing in bulk; and, from observations made by M.
Beaumier, the French Consul, it appears to have been reduced about
one-fourth in area in twenty years; but whether from denudation or
subsidence is not clear. The sea is, however, sensibly encroaching,
as an old Portuguese fort and some Moorish buildings are now
environed with sand and salt-marsh close to the sea, in a position
where they would not have been built. This submergence of the coast
at Mogador may perhaps be contemporaneous with the subsidence at
Benghazi, Barbary, described by Mr. G. B. Stacey in the
twenty-third volume of the ‘Quarterly Journal of the Geological
Society.’ The general absence of cliffs characterises nearly the
whole of the Barbary coast. A few low cliffs occur at scattered
intervals west of Tangier; but from Cape Spartel to Cape Cantin a
low monotonous coast shelves under the waters of the Atlantic, and
not a cliff is to be seen, save an occasional raised beach. After
rounding Cape Cantin the coast trends nearly north and south; and
here the first good coast-section presents itself as a vertical
cliff nearly 200 feet high (fig. 1), consisting of nearly level
stratified alternations of grey and reddish marl, and fine-grained
sandstone with beds of argillaceous carbonate of iron resembling
the cement-stone of the Kimmeridge clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">[451]</span>At a distance
the cliff has a massive rocky aspect due to the vertical
infiltration of tufaceous seams, which support the softer beds and
stand out in prominent masses. The cliffs continue southwards to
Saffi, where I obtained a small series of fossils from the section
represented in fig. 1, amongst which Mr. Etheridge has determined
<i>Exogyra conica</i>, <i>Ostrea Leymerii</i>, and <i>0.
Boussingaulti</i>. He considers the beds to be of Neocomian age.
The hard band c is almost entirely made up of <i>Exogyra
conica</i>.</p>

Mogador, for a specimen of <i>Ostrea Leymerii</i>, brought</p>

<p>Two or three miles south of Saffi another section occurs, known
as the ‘Jew’s Cliff;’ and from this Dr. Hooker, who landed on his
homeward voyage, obtained a few fossils, viz. several
undeterminable species of <i>Pecten</i>; an <i>Ostrea</i> allied to

to be of Miocene age; and the ‘Jew’s Cliff’ section may probably
give the key to the age of the beds of the Marocco<span class=

fossils. In connection with the occurrence of these Tertiary beds
at Saffi, I must refer to MM. Desquin and Mourlon’s observations in

place called Sidi Moussa, calcareous tufas associated with flints
occur, containing</p>

are characterised by the presence of little <i>Paludinas</i>,
whilst those of Sidi Moussa are full of vermiculiform<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_453">[453]</span> perforations. The depressions
are occupied by a very porous conglomerate, passing into a
calcareous sandstone used for building. This conglomerate contains
an abundance of <i>Helix vermiculata</i>, a species living in the
country, and also found in the calcareous sands which are supposed
to be of post-Pliocene age. The plain of Doukala (<i>Ducaila</i> of
Washington), at a level of about 140 feet above the sea, is covered
with these sands. At Sidi Ammer an escarpment was observed, the
base of which consisted of clay and red ferruginous marls,
containing a stratum formed for the most part of oysters, in which
also <i>Teredina personata</i> occurred, supposed by M. Nyst to
belong to the Eocene formation; succeeded by another fossiliferous
bed containing</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="nind">supposed by M. Nyst to be Miocene, the upper part
of the escarpment resembling the beds of later age before
described.</p>

<p>An examination of the higher points of the western coast near
Saffi, and at Azfi in the province of Abda, near Mazagan, tended to
establish the fact of the occurrence of Pliocene beds in the
district.</p>

<p>At Cape Saffi, 180 metres in altitude, a reddish calcareous sand
was met with abounding in <i>Cyclostoma</i>, <i>Cylindrellas</i>,
and a species of <i>Helix</i> differing from that at Mazagan; and
at other points, including the hill of Aher and at Sidi Bousid,
white marls and sands associated with calcareous sandstones were
met with analogous to the supposed quaternary beds in the
neighbourhood of Mazagan.</p>

<p>The only other point in the geology of the coast-line I have to
refer to is the great mass of blown sand surrounding Mogador,
presenting a weird expanse of sea-like waves of sand, on a scale
vastly greater than anything of the kind on our own coast, mimetic
of mountain-chains and bold escarpments in miniature, differing
only from true hill-and-valley structure in the absence of
continuous valley-lines, the hollows being completely surrounded by
higher ground. Many of the ranges of sand are from 80 to 100 feet
in height, and their perfectly straight<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_454">[454]</span> scarped faces are produced by the violent
westerly gales blowing the sand up the angle of repose, and
accumulating it in fountain-like showers over the rounded backs of
the sand-hill ranges.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that the sub-aërial ripple-markings
superimposed on the greater undulations, occupy a reversed position
with reference to the prevalent winds, their long side facing the
wind, with the more vertical straight scarps on the lee side. The
moving sand in this case is drifted up the long side, and falls
over the scarp at the angle of repose.</p>

<p><em>The Plain of Marocco.</em>—We now turn inland; and before
referring to the details of the structure of the Great Atlas range,
it will save repetition if I briefly describe the general contour
of the district under consideration. Leaving the sand-hills, which
die out inland, and travelling westward, we gradually ascend over
an undulating country, in aspect somewhat like the Weald of Sussex,
covered for 30 miles with Argan Forest, till we reach, at 60 miles
inland, the average level of the plain, about 1,700 feet above the
sea.</p>

<p>The fundamental rock is here rarely to be seen; for the entire
face of the country is shrouded over by a sheet-like covering of
tufaceous crust (fig. 3), rising over hill and valley, and
following all the undulations of the ground. Only in river-beds and
here and there by the side of a hill were the fundamental beds
visible, and seen to consist of alternations of hard and soft
cream-coloured calcareous strata, dipping and undulating in various
directions at low angles, and so closely resembling the surface
crust that it was difficult to distinguish the one from the other,
unless the surface crust happened to lap unconformably over the
scarped exposures of the stratified beds. This singular deposit
varies in thickness from a few inches to two or three feet, and is
taken advantage of by the Moors for the excavation of cellars in
the soft ground, over which the crust forms a strong roof. These
are termed <i>matamoras</i>, and are used for the storage of grain,
and as receptacles for burying the refuse from the villages. The
calcareous crust in the neighbourhood of Marocco is extensively
burned for lime. In section it presents a banded agatescent
structure, often much brecciated. It is impossible it can have been
deposited by any waterflow, as completely isolated hills are
shrouded over by it as thickly as the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_455">[455]</span> valley bottoms; and the only satisfactory
explanation of its origin I can suggest is, that it results from
the intense heat of the sun rapidly drawing up water charged with
soluble carbonate of lime from the calcareous strata, and drying it
layer by layer on the surface, till an accumulation several feet
thick has been produced. The rapid alternations of heavy rains and
scorching heat which take place in the Marocco plain are conditions
favourable to this phenomenon, which is unknown in northern
temperate climates.</p>

</div>

<p>A familiar illustration of the same kind of action is seen in
what brickmakers term ‘limewash.’ A brick formed of marl containing
soluble carbonate of lime, if rapidly dried or placed in the clamp
in a wet state, will have on its upper surface, after burning, an
unsightly white scum or crust, by the accretion of soluble matter
driven upwards and outwards by the quick evaporation. Before we
left Mogador on our journey inland,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_456">[456]</span> we were told of great beds of shingle
covering the plain, and fully anticipated some interesting drift
phenomena; but these shingle-beds were found to be nothing more
than the broken débris of the surface tufa, covering the plain for
hundreds of square miles with stony fragments. Of marine drift
there is not a vestige, the few isolated patches of waterworn
stones and alluvial shingle being always connected with river
valleys, excepting only the huge boulder deposits of the Atlas
hereafter to be referred to.</p>

<p>About midway between Mogador and the city of Marocco, the
monotony of the plain is broken by a curious group of flat-topped
hills, which rise two or three hundred feet above its</p>

<div class="figcenter iw2">

<p class="less"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 4.</p>

<p class="less">‘Camel’s Back,’ flat-topped hills in the Plain of

</div>

<p class="nind">general surface. They present straight scarped
sides, on which are exposed cream-coloured calcareous strata capped
with a flat tabular layer of chalcedony, which seems, in arresting
denudation, to have determined their peculiar and symmetrical form.
In these we found no fossils; and I am doubtful whether they are an
inland extension of the Miocene beds observed by Dr. Hooker at the
‘Jew’s Cliff,’ near Saffi, or are some members of the Cretaceous
series, of which there are sections on the coast north of Saffi and
on the flanks of the Atlas.</p>

<p>At this point the main boundaries of the plain come into full
view,—on the north a rugged range of mountains trending east and
west, which we estimated at from 2,000 to 3,000 feet in height; and
on our right the great chain of the Atlas, rising 11,000 feet above
us and between 12,000 and 13,000 feet above<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_457">[457]</span> the sea, bounds the view to the south,
framing-in the great plain, here some 50 miles broad, which is lost
as a level horizon in the eastern distance.</p>

<p><em>The Atlas Range.</em>—Commencing at Cape Guer, on the
Atlantic sea-board, the range, which at a little distance has the
aspect of a single ridge, averages at its western extremity from
4,000 to 5,000 feet in height, from which it slightly falls off in
height for a few miles, and then gradually increases in height as
it recedes from the coast. In the eastern part of the province of
Haha the summits probably attain to a height of about 10,000 feet.
At a point about 60 miles from the sea there is a comparatively
deep breach in the range, through which runs the main road to
Tarudant. Eastward of that pass the projecting summits appear to
lie between 11,000 and 11,500 feet above the sea to a distance from
the coast of about 100 miles, and about SW. of the city of Marocco,
where a second depression occurs, affording a pass to the south, at
an altitude of about 7,000 feet. Immediately east of this, and due
south of the city of Marocco, the range for 30 miles in length
presents a long unbroken ridge, 12,000 feet in height, on which are
deposited a few isolated crags and peaks rising from 500 to 800
feet above the general level; and it is doubtful whether this part
of the chain attains an extreme height of 13,000 feet. Still
farther east the ridge-like character is lost, the range becoming
broken up into a series of less continuous peaks (including
Miltsin, estimated by Lieut. Washington to be 11,400 feet in
altitude, and supposed by him to be the highest point in the chain)
of diminished height: beyond this, eastward, little or nothing is
known either of the altitude or character of the range, excepting
that it trends NE. by E. towards the southern borders of Algeria on
the Sahara.</p>

<p>Rohlfs, in his journal of his overland journey from Marocco to
Tripoli, speaks of mountains to the east of Marocco being covered
with <em>perpetual</em> snow; but this is a character which has
been erroneously attributed to the Maroccan section of the Atlas
range. When we arrived at Marocco in the first week of May, the
snow was limited to steep gullies and drifts—all the exposed
parts, including the very summit, being entirely bare. There were,
however, frequent storms, which intermittently covered the range
down to 7,000 or 8,000 feet; but it is certain that these
occasional falls would be rapidly cleared off<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_458">[458]</span> by the summer heat; and we came to the
conclusion that there was nothing like perpetual snow on any
portion of the chain we visited, included in the section
(apparently the highest part) lying due south of the city of
Marocco.</p>

<p>As seen from the city, the great ridge appears to rise abruptly
from the plain some 25 miles off; and so deceptive is the distance,
that it looks as though it were a direct ascent from the plain to
the snow-capped summit, even too steep to scale; but in reality
this wall-like ridge represents a horizontal distance of 15 miles
or more from the foot to the summit. As we approached it, an
irregular plateau four or five miles wide was seen to form a sort
of foreground to the great mass of the chain, from 2,000 to 3,000
feet above the plain, and 4,000 to 5,000 feet above the sea-level.
This is intersected by occasional narrow ravines, which wind up to
the crest of the ridge; and its face, fronting the plain, is for
the most part exposed as an escarpment of red sandstone and
limestone beds dipping away from the plain, and again rising from a
synclinal against the crystalline porphyrites of the centre of the
ridge, and unconformably overlying nearly vertical grey shaly beds
with a strike ranging with the general trend of the Atlas range.
Against the plateau escarpment rest enormous mounds of boulders
spreading down to the level plain.</p>

<p>These, then, are the general features of the chain of the Atlas
and plain of Marocco, the further details of which it will be
convenient to consider under the following heads:—</p>

<div class="sep">
<p>(<em>a</em>) Surface Deposits and Boulder Beds.</p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) Porphyrites.</p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) Eruptive Basalts.</p>
</div>

<p>(a) <em>Surface Deposits and Boulder-beds.</em>—Next to the Tufa
crust already described, which extends over almost the entire plain
of Marocco, perhaps the most remarkable feature in the physical
geology of the country is the enormous deposit of boulders that
occurs in the lateral valleys, and flanks the great chain on its
confines with the plain. Of marine drift there is<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_459">[459]</span> not a trace; and alluvial
drift and valley gravels are very limited in their distribution,
being confined to the borders of a few insignificant rivers that
intersect the plain and the localities of occasional waterflows;
but as soon as the flanks of the Atlas are reached, new and
distinct drift phenomena present themselves. It was on our second
day’s journey from Marocco to the Atlas that the great boulder-beds
came under our notice, first in a valley leading up from Mesfioua
to Tasseremout, as scattered blocks of red sandstone, remarkable
for their large average size, many of them of from ten to twenty
cubic yards; but here the method of their disposition scarcely
enabled us to decide that they were other than stream-borne masses
from the higher ground. From Tasseremout we turned west, and at
the</p>

(Section.)</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p class="nind">mouth of a second valley, two miles from the
village, suddenly came upon a huge development of these Red
Sandstone boulder-beds as great ridge-like and very symmetrical
masses with terminal faces three or four hundred feet high, and,
like the more scattered blocks NW. of Tasseremout, intermixed with
but a very small proportion of fine matter. From this valley we
turned out northwards, skirting the escarpment facing the plain;
and for more than ten miles no lateral valley breaks into the
cliff-like face; but below it the great boulder-beds (figs. 5, 6)
still occur in huge masses not resting directly against the
escarpment, but as isolated mounds two or three hundred feet in
advance, sloping down towards the escarpment in one direction, and
in the other rolling away in great wave-like ridges and undulating
sheets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">[460]</span> which
terminate at a well-marked line of demarcation, just where the
level portion of the plain commences. I measured by aneroid the
height of these mounds; and at one point their summit was 3,950
feet above the sea-level, from which they spread down
uninterruptedly to the edge of the plain nearly 2,000 feet below.
They bear a striking resemblance to the glacial ridges or escars
between Edinburgh and Perth; their mound-like structure is
distinctly visible from the city of Marocco, twenty-five miles off,
appearing like a row of pyramidal tali resting against the face of
the escarpment as though they had been cast down from its edge on
to the plain. The internal structure of the mounds also suggests
such a deviation from the</p>

<p class="nind">disposition of the boulders in layers sloping away
from the escarpment towards the plain; and on a nearer approach it
is seen that the individual mounds are not connected with channels

<p>The depression between the escarpment and the drift-mounds is a
remarkable feature, and suggests an entire change of conditions
since the boulder-beds were deposited. If they are a mere
sub-aërial talus, they should rest directly against the cliff face,
and the depression separating them must have been formed after the
accumulation had ceased; and yet no satisfactory reason can be
assigned for such cessation, if rain and river action were the only
operating causes. The form of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_461">[461]</span> mounds in the valley west of Tasseremout at
once conveyed to me the impression that they were of glacial
origin; and the discovery of undoubted moraines in the higher
valleys strengthened my conviction that the boulder-mounds and
ridges flanking the Atlas plateau can only be satisfactorily
explained as the result of glaciers covering the escarpment,
leaving on their recession the intermediate depression.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Moraines of the Higher Atlas.</em>—Kindred phenomena
occur higher up in the Atlas valleys, most notable in the case of
unquestionable moraines, commencing at the village of Adjersiman,
in the province of Reraya, at an altitude of 6,000 feet. Here we
met with a gigantic ridge of porphyry blocks, having a terminal
angle of repose of between 800 and 900 feet in vertical height, and
grouped with several other mounds and ridges of similar scale, all
composed of great masses of rock with little or no admixture of
small fragments, and completely damming up the steep ravine and
retaining behind it a small alluvial plain 6,700 feet above the
sea-level.</p>

<p>We failed to detect any scratched blocks or striæ; but that
these ridges are true glacial moraines no one who has seen them and
compared them with other glacial phenomena would for a moment
doubt; and their interrupted occurrence at various heights is
strictly in accordance with the distribution of moraines in many of
the Swiss and Scotch valleys.</p>

<p>Lieut. Washington, in referring to the pointed mountainous hills
NW. of the city of Marocco, crossed on his homeward journey,
describes one of them as being ‘covered with masses of gneiss and
coarse-grained granite (? diorite), many of the blocks being
several tons in weight,’ and asks, ‘how got they there?’ ‘If
granite, the nearest granite mountains are at a distance of
twenty-five to thirty miles: can they be boulders?’ As far as my
own observations go, there was no rock <i>in situ</i> in the part
of this range I visited near Marocco resembling granite or diorite;
and in connection with the boulder-mounds of the Atlas, the
occurrence of foreign blocks north of the plain of Marocco so far
from the parent source, is a circumstance of great interest.</p>

<p>(c) <em>Stratified Red Sandstone and Limestone Series.</em>—A
long line of comparatively low and flattish hills, forming a
plateau, with an average height of about 4,500 feet above the sea,
and 2,800 feet above the plain of Marocco, intervenes between
it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">[462]</span> and the main
ridge of the Atlas. The edge of this plateau facing the plain is
for some distance an escarpment, exposing stratified beds of
limestone containing bands of chalcedonic concretions, underlain by
grey and puce-coloured marls. As this plateau is crossed from north
to south towards the Atlas ridge, its central line would represent
a synclinal, from which the beds rise northwards towards the plain
and southwards towards the Atlas; but it is locally broken and
contorted, and near Tasseremout the limestone beds stand up nearly
on end. South of the synclinal, <i>i.e.</i> between the centre of
the irregular plateau and the Atlas, great deposits of red
sandstone and dark-red conglomerate, interstratified with
cream-coloured shelly limestone, occur, which appear to be inferior
members of the series of limestones and marls exposed in the
escarpment facing the plain. Lieut. Washington, who ascended
Miltsin to a height of 6,400 feet, describes hard red sandstone
with an east and west strike dipping 10° south, as occurring at
this elevation, which is nearly 2,000 feet higher than we observed
the Red Sandstone series in the province of Reraya farther west,
and also both in his approach and descent from Miltsin of ranges of
limestone running NE. and SW. dipping 70° SE. with abrupt sterile
sandstone mountains rising above them. From the few obscure
fossils, including an <i>Ostrea</i>, I was able to collect from the
limestone bands, Mr. Etheridge considers that they are of
Cretaceous age. They are, like the beds of the plain, remarkable
for containing great deposits of chalcedonic concretions; but the
latter may possibly be of more recent age. They rest unconformably
on the upturned edges of grey shaly beds, and extend also over the
porphyries that form the great mass of the Atlas chain. They appear
to have been deposited subsequently to the porphyry ridge assuming
its present hill-and-valley contour, as little isolated fragments
are seen clinging to the sides of a narrow ravine leading out of
the valley we ascended through the province of Reraya to the Atlas.
Their relation to the few exposures of stratified beds in the plain
is somewhat uncertain, as no fossils were obtained in the latter,
and there are no direct connecting links; but, judging from
petrological similarity, and from the fact that Neocomian fossils
occur in exposed beds on the coast cliffs, and Cretaceous fossils
in the beds forming the crest of the plateau, it seems possible
that an unbroken series<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_463">[463]</span> occurs from the cliff north of Saffi to the
plateau skirting the Atlas, representing the whole of the
Cretaceous epoch; but it is also open to question whether the level
beds of the plain may not be an inland extension of the strata of
Miocene age from which Dr. Hooker obtained fossils at the Jew’s
Cliff south of Saffi.</p>

<p>(d) <em>Grey Shales.</em>—At several points on entering the
lateral valleys of the Atlas, almost vertical shaly beds are
crossed, having a strike nearly east and west, corresponding with
the trend of the chain. They clearly underlie, and are
unconformable to, the Red Sandstone and Limestone series; and their
almost vertical position appears connected with one of the several
upheavals that have affected the chain. Of their geological age
there is no evidence, except that they are pre-Cretaceous. In
places, as at Assghin, they abound in nodules of carbonate of iron.
Pale shales, containing quartz veins, crop up near the village of
Frouga, in the plain south-west of Marocco, which may possibly
belong to this series; and if the porphyries forming the mass of
the Atlas are contemporaneous, they are probably interbedded with
these grey shaly beds. Lieut. Washington speaks of the occurrence
of clay-slate dipping 45° east between El Mansoria and Fidallah,
and again of a hilly country of clay-slate near the plain of Smira,
and at Peira, farther south; but it is impossible to say whether
these beds are related to the grey shales of the Atlas.</p>

<p>(e) <em>Metamorphic Rocks.</em>—The most important development
of metamorphic rocks in the neighbourhood of Marocco is on the
north side of the city. In its immediate neighbourhood, three miles
to the north-west, a low rugged hill occurs, composed of a very
hard and compact dark-grey rock, containing knotted white
concretions elongated in the line of stratification, which dips
from 50° to 80° south-west, the strike being north-west and
south-east. The whole of the north side of the plain is bounded by
ranges of rugged hills of similar form, and apparently rising from
2,000 to 3,000 feet above the plain. We had not an opportunity of
visiting them; but, judging from their outline, they are identical
in formation with the hill close to Marocco. We observed nothing in
the Atlas resembling it. Lieut. Washington, who crossed these hills
on his journey to Marocco at about the point I visited, and again
forty miles to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">[464]</span> the
east, near the source of the river Tensift, on his homeward
journey, speaks of them as from 500 to 1,200 feet in height,
consisting of micaceous schist and a schistose rock with veins of
quartz dipping 75°, with a strike north by east and south by west.
The strike may vary a little at different points, and, taking
Lieut. Washington’s and my own observations together, would average
about north and south; and it is worthy of note that these
apparently ancient rocks are nearly at right angles to the strike
of the rocks of the Atlas chain a few miles to the south.</p>

<p>The only other metamorphic rocks that came under our notice
were:—first, white marble or metamorphic limestone, intercalated
with the porphyrites at the summit of the ridge of the Atlas south
of Arround; secondly, mica-schists, pierced by red porphyry dykes,
forming the mass of Djebel Tezah, a peak 11,000 feet in height, and
fifteen miles farther west, ascended by Dr. Hooker and Mr. Ball
after my return. It is possible that the mica-schists may be a
portion of the grey-shale series, metamorphosed by the intrusion of
the porphyry dykes. Lieut. Washington, on his first day’s journey
south of Tangier, refers to the occurrence of rounded schistose
hills about 300 feet high, strike north-west and south-east, dip
75° south-west, containing mica-slate with veins of foliated
quartz; but I have no recollection of observing any such
metamorphic rocks between Tangier and Tetuan.</p>

<p>(f) <em>Porphyrites.</em>—Of the eruptive rocks of the Atlas,
porphyrites and porphyritic tuffs occupy by far the most prominent
position, forming the great mass of its ridge.</p>

<p>On entering the lateral valleys, after crossing the vertical
shaly beds, great masses of red porphyrites and tuffs are met with,
associated with specular iron and occasional green porphyries. The
harder portions of the latter are seen as <i>Verde antique</i>
pebbles in the river-beds; but we failed to detect this <i>in
situ</i>. From the large proportion of tuffs that occurs the
porphyrites appear to be interbedded, and are possibly
contemporaneous with the vertical grey shales to which they are
adjacent. They are overlapped unconformably by the Red Sandstone
and Limestone series of Cretaceous age. The late Mr. D. Forbes
informed me that they bear a strong likeness to the porphyrites of
the Andes, of Oolitic age; but beyond the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_465">[465]</span> fact that they were in existence and had
undergone denudation into hill-and-valley contour before the
Cretaceous beds were deposited over them, there is no certain
evidence as to their age.</p>

<p>There may have been at least one or two subsequent intrusions of
red porphyrites, viz. of the dykes of Djebel Tezah, metamorphosing
grey shales into mica-schists, and of the dykes that break up
through the stratified beds of the plain east of Sheshaoua—which
may probably be more recent than the porphyrites of the Atlas, as
they appear to penetrate strata which extend over the denuded
surface of the Atlas mass; but I cannot speak with certainty as to
the relative age of the stratified beds and the porphyritic bosses
which rise up out of the plain.</p>

<p>(g) <em>Eruptive Basalts.</em>—Of these we met with three
distinct species:—</p>

<p>(1) Black vesicular basalt (porous and compact pyroxenic lava
with olivine) on the coast near Mogador, and imbedded in the base
of the post-Tertiary concrete sandstone cliffs: but it was nowhere
seen <i>in situ</i>; and I think it possible that the fragments may
have been derived from the Canary Islands, which are only 70 or 80
miles distant, or possibly from some point of eruption nearer the
land.</p>

<p>(2) Amygdaloid green Basalt, which rises up in dykes, in many
places penetrating the Red Sandstone and Limestone series on the
flanks of the Atlas, and also piercing the diorite of the Arround
valley. We observed numerous dykes at Tasseremout, Tassgirt, and
Asni, south-east and south of Marocco city. Beyond the fact that
they are probably post-Cretaceous, there is no evidence as to their
age. From what we could see of their distribution, the whole range
of the Atlas seems abundantly intersected by these dykes.</p>

<p>(3) Diorite rises up in considerable masses among the
porphyrites in the valley of the Arround, due south of Marocco, but
forms no great proportion of the bulk of the ridge. Its intrusion
may have been contemporaneous with the dislocation and upturning of
the Red Sandstone and Limestone series overlying the
porphyrites.</p>

<p><em>General Summary.</em>—It now only remains briefly to
recapitulate the order of sequence of the geological phenomena
observed in the plain of Marocco and the Atlas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">[466]</span>The oldest rocks
that have been noticed are:—</p>

<p>(1) The ranges of rugged metamorphic rocks north of the city of
Marocco, and forming the northern boundary of the plain, respecting
the age of which, and the period of their upheaval and
metamorphism, there is no evidence.</p>

<p>(2) The interbedded porphyrites and porphyritic tuffs of the
Atlas, forming the backbone of the ridge, the age of which, and of
the grey shales with which they seem to be interbedded, is also
uncertain.</p>

<p>(3) Mica-schists of Djebel Tezah, in the Atlas, south-west of
Marocco, pierced with eruptive porphyritic dykes, which may be an
altered condition of the vertical grey shales adjacent to the
interbedded porphyrites.</p>

<p>These rocks are our starting point, respecting which there is no
evidence of their age, or even relative age.</p>

<p>(4) We now come to a long period of denudation of the Atlas
ridge, and its sculpturing into hill-and-valley contour, before the
deposition of the Red Sandstone and Limestone series.</p>

<p>(5) The deposition over what is now the Marocco plain, of the
Cretaceous Red Sandstone and Limestone series (and beds possibly of
Miocene age), which also occupies pre-existing valleys in the older
porphyrites of the Atlas.</p>

<p>(6) The intrusion of diorite into the porphyrites and
porphyritic tuffs, probably accompanied by a further elevation of
the Atlas range, disturbing the stratified Red Sandstone and
Limestone series, throwing them into a synclinal trough, from which
the beds rise northwards towards the plain, and southwards towards
the Atlas.</p>

<p>(7) A further long period of denudation of the Red Sandstone and
Limestone series, rescooping out the lateral valleys of the Atlas,
in continuation of the valleys that existed in the porphyrite ridge
prior to their deposition, and also denuding the beds in the
Marocco plain to the extent of at least 300 feet, leaving isolated
remnants as flat tabular hills rising above the present general
level of the plain.</p>

<p>(8) A further possible emission of red porphyrites through the
stratified beds of the plain, which may have been contemporaneous
with the eruption of the red porphyry dykes of Djebel Tezah, in the
High Atlas; but I could not clearly<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_467">[467]</span> ascertain whether these bosses really
pierced the stratified beds, or were existing before their
deposition.</p>

<div class="margins">
<p>(9) A post-Cretaceous eruption through the Red Sandstone and
Limestone series of a multitude of dykes of amygdaloid basalt, the
age of which is uncertain.</p>

<p>The more recent changes commence with:—</p>

<p>(10) The formation of gigantic boulder-beds flanking the
northern escarpment of the Atlas plateau, and spreading down in
great mounds and undulating ridges from a height of 3,900 feet to
the borders of the plain, 1,900 feet above the sea, with a range in
vertical height of about 2,000 feet, and extending up the entrances
of several of the lateral valleys, as well-defined and symmetrical
moraines.</p>

<p>(11) The formation of moraines at the heads of the Atlas
valleys, commencing at a height of 5,800 feet, and spreading up to
the cliffs of the Atlas ridge, to a height of between 7,000 and
8,000 feet, with a terminal angle of repose 850 feet in vertical
height.</p>

<p>(12) The formation of a plain of shingle behind the moraines, at
a height of about 6,700 feet, which seems to be the bed of a small
lake.</p>

<p>(13) The recession and extinction of glaciers in the Atlas
range, on which there is now not even perpetual snow.</p>

<p>(14) An elevation of the coast-line of at least 70 feet,
represented by the height of the raised beaches of concrete sand at
Mogador and other parts of the coast, which may possibly be
contemporaneous with the elevation of similar raised beaches on the
coasts of Spain and Portugal, and with the raised beaches of our
south-western coast.</p>

<p>(15) A slight subsidence of the coast-line, now going on, with
an accumulation of extensive deposits of blown sand at Mogador.</p>

<p>(16) The formation of a tufaceous surface-crust over almost the
entire plain of Marocco, due to the drawing up to the surface, by
rapid evaporation, of water from the subjacent calcareous strata,
depositing, layer by layer, laminated carbonate of lime.</p>

<p class="center less space-below15">MOORISH STORIES AND
FABLES.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">From</span> much information that
has been kindly furnished to us by Mr. Freeman Rogers, a gentleman
who was several years resident in Marocco, and had become familiar
with the people and their language and manners, the following
extracts have been taken for the sake of the light which they throw
on the condition of the country. It being the main object of this
volume to relate our personal experiences, we have not been able to
avail ourselves of much information supplied to us by Mr. Rogers,
and other competent witnesses; but it has appeared to us that the
extracts here given form a useful supplement to the facts which
came to our knowledge during our short stay in Marocco, and will
help the reader to form a truer conception of its present
condition.</p>

<p>The stories, which may be said to have a political character,
furnished to us by Mr. F. Rogers, all refer to events that have
occurred during the last twenty-five years, and are precisely
similar in character to others which were passing at the time of
our visit. They are accepted as substantially accurate by our
informant, and we see no reason to refuse them credence. They
certainly tally with the universal belief of the natives as to the
conduct of their rulers. Any one who is familiar with the
chronicles of the Middle Ages, who has marvelled at the deeds of
ferocious cruelty recorded of German petty rulers, or the more
refined atrocities of Italian princes, must sometimes have felt a
wish to know what manner of men they were who committed these
deeds. To satisfy such a curiosity, he cannot do better than pay a
visit to the interior of Marocco. If duly commended to their good
offices, he will be received by men of stately and courteous
manners, prompt to display a lavish hospitality, who will
inevitably send him away with a favourable impression; but before
he has been many weeks in the country, he will become aware that
these amiable hosts are habitually guilty of deeds of combined
ferocity and treachery that equal, if they do not surpass, those of
the dark periods of European history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">[469]</span>The popular
fables, which were taken down from the mouth of an old Moorish
story-teller, and literally translated by Mr. Rogers, complete the
impression derived from the fragments of contemporary history. They
all turn upon the success of fraud and force in the affair’s of
life. The moral, so to speak, of all is ‘woe to the weak and the
confiding;’ but admiration is mainly given to those who supply the
place of strength by successful perfidy.</p>

<h3><em>Abd el Saddock, Kaïd of Mogador, Duquallah, Abda, and
Sous.</em><a id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a>
</h3>

<p>On one occasion this Kaïd was sent to Sous by the Sultan to
reduce some provinces to submission. When arrived there, a grand
entertainment was given to him by the refractory Sheiks, and
immense quantities of provisions sent in to supply the guests,
among which was a large quantity of a particular dish of which the
Kaïd was known to be very fond, and this was all poisoned. The
Kaïd, suspecting from the Sheiks’ importunity for him to eat of it
that it was poisoned, ordered his soldiers to guard the doors and
let no one escape, and then called upon the Sheiks one by one to
partake of the dish. Most of the Sheiks refused to eat, and some
few came cheerfully forward at the Kaïd’s call; those who refused
were compelled to eat, and those who came cheerfully forward were
not allowed to eat; and so the Kaïd in one day not only got rid of
his enemies, but saved his friends, whom he rewarded by putting
them in the place of those who fell by their own treachery.</p>

<h3><em>Kaïd Boh Djemma.</em>
</h3>

<p>Some short time after the news of the foregoing had spread over
the country, a revolt took place at Shedma, and many of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_470">[470]</span> the Sheiks made themselves
conspicuous by their opposition to the Kaïd, who determined to get
rid of all his enemies at one blow; he therefore made peace with
them, and all seemed well and tranquil for some time. At last came
the holiday <i>l’ashora</i>, or the day of the Sultan’s tenthing,
when an invitation was issued by the Kaïd to all his Sheiks to
appear at his entertainment; none dare refuse, and so all went. The
Kaïd had, in the meantime, prepared a large room, into which he
sent the Sheiks known to be his enemies, and another into which he
sent those known to be his friends. When all had feasted until they
could eat no more, the Kaïd quietly ordered the windows and doors
to be closed, the men to be bound, burning charcoal to be placed in
the room, and the doors then to be built up, and all left to their
fate. Nine days afterwards, when the room was opened, nothing
remained of all those men, some twenty-two or twenty-three, but
bones, attesting the fatal effects of burning charcoal and the
daring ferocity of the rats; except one man whom the Kaïd pardoned,
believing him to be innocent, as his life seemed to be so
miraculously preserved.</p>

<h3><em>What the Sultan means when he bestows a Wife.</em>
</h3>

<p>The Kaïd of Shedmah, Boh Djemma, had distinguished himself
against some rebels who had risen against the Sultan, and the
praise bestowed upon him openly by his enemies in the hearing of
the Sultan, excited the suspicious sovereign’s anger and jealousy
to such an extent that he was determined to get rid of such a
dangerous enemy; in order to which he called for the Kaïd and
praised his exploits in the presence of all his great men, ordered
him a suit of his own royal clothing and a favourite horse, and
promised him a wife out of his own seraglio. The Kaïd rejoiced, and
his enemies too: the Kaïd, because he regarded himself as a
favourite; and his enemies, who were older and knew better, because
that he was doomed. In a few days the Kaïd was sent home and his
new wife along with him in great state, and in ten days more the
Kaïd was carried to the grave, he having died suddenly (poisoned by
the Sultan’s female executioner) in the night.</p>

<p>A similar occurrence took place with the Kaïd of Haha; but he
had a watchful and wise mother, who watched the new<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_471">[471]</span> wife until she saw her prepare
a dish for her son, when she presented herself before him, charged
the new wife with her intended crime, and dared her to eat of her
own dish. The Kaïd’s eyes were opened, and he compelled the
Sultan’s lady, his new wife, to eat of the dish which she had
prepared for him, when she immediately died from the effects of her
own poison. This Kaïd ever after kept away from the Sultan until, a
few years ago, his evil genius prevailed on him to obey the
Sultan’s call, when he died within an hour after taking supper with
the Sultan.</p>

<h3><em>Abd el Saddock, Kaïd of Mogador, Duquallah, Abda, and Sous,
and his False Friend.</em>
</h3>

<p>Some years since, the Kaïd of Mogador<a id=
"FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
(father of the Kaïd Hadj Amara who entertained you when there)
ruled over the provinces of Duquallah, Sous, and Abda, and made a
great deal of money during his administration, and secured the love
of all good Moors by his making the Jews acknowledge their
inferiority to the Moors. But suspecting that his time to be
squeezed by the Sultan had nearly arrived, he determined to prepare
for it, and so outwit a false friend, who was an enemy of his, and
the Sultan at the same time; in order to which, he called upon his
false friend, and invited him to dine with him that evening in
private as he had something to tell him. After dinner the Kaïd told
his guest that he was getting afraid of the Sultan seizing him in
order to get his money. ‘Now,’ said he, ‘I have a favour to ask of
you, which is that you will carefully preserve the treasure which I
will show you, and when I am seized upon take the keys of my house,
but do not live in it, and when my son Hamara knows how to use my
money, then tell him of the box and give him the keys; and further,
I want you to swear that you will never tell where I have hid my
treasure, and that you will not tell any one of what has passed
this night.’ The false friend took the oath with mental
reservations, as would appear from the sequel. The Kaïd then
ordered four slaves to attend upon him, and all descended to the
cellar, where the money was concealed in a large strong wooden box,
buried in the ground. The box was then opened<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_472">[472]</span> and was seen to be full of silver and
gold, &amp;c. The Kaïd then had the box covered up, and the false
friend took his departure. After he went away, the Kaïd returned
with his slaves and had the money, but not the box, removed to a
really secure place, and had the box filled with bits of stones and
broken pottery and recovered over in the same manner as it was
before, when seen by the Kaïd’s false confidant; he then had his
slaves carried off to prison and put to death on some pretext or
other. The next day when the Kaïd’s confidant heard of the slaves
being dead, he knew it was to prevent their telling, and concluded
that it was the secret which he possessed which the Kaïd wanted to
guard, and that he alone knew of the secret of the Kaïd’s wealth
and its hiding place. In some short time afterwards, an order came
from the Sultan ordering Abd el Saddock up to Marocco; upon which
the Kaïd told his confidant of his trouble and begged him to be
true to his oath, blessed him, kissed him, and then went to wait
upon the Sultan. The Sultan upon seeing him ordered his arrest and
torture, accusing him of robbing him and his people, &amp;c.; upon
which the Kaïd was carried off to the torture, when he kept denying
having any money, and being guilty of the charges brought against
him. At last the Sultan, losing all patience, sent him word that he
had received information, so the Kaïd had better speak the truth at
once, for such a one (the false friend) had declared that he had a
large box full of treasure, but was sworn not to tell of its
whereabouts. The Kaïd, therefore, must either tell or suffer death
by torture. At this the Kaïd pretended to be much alarmed, and
declared that nothing could be concealed from Seedna, so he would
confess the whole truth, and that what such a one said was true and
that it was concealed in such a place, and put there in presence of
such a one (the informer, the Kaïd’s confidant), and that if the
Sultan sent for it he would have it all. The Kaïd was then put in
prison, and notaries and soldiers sent for the money under the
guidance of the informer who was in great glee, thinking that now
his fortune was made and his favour with the Sultan secure; but
upon arriving at the cellar and the box being opened, nothing but
stones and broken pottery was found where there had been gold and
silver. Imagine the wretch’s horror as the notaries said he himself
must inform the Sultan, as they dare not<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_473">[473]</span> do so; however, as there was no use in
lamenting, they returned to Marocco, and the informer had to tell
Seedna that there was nothing in the box but rubbish; upon which
the Sultan ordered the Kaïd to be brought before him and demanded
the meaning of such a thing. The Kaïd answered, ‘True, our lord, it
is that I did not oppress your people, and the money hidden in that
box was made by lawful means, and I reposed confidence in my friend
here, and left the money for my son; and so I told your majesty
truly that I had nothing, because it then became by my gift my
son’s money, and this, my false friend, has broken his trust,
robbed my son and Seedna, and then to cover his knavery, sought my
life by trying to turn our lord against me. I therefore beg that
our lord will make him confess what he has done with Seedna’s
money.’ The Sultan thought the informer simply wanted to make him a
fool to cover his knavery, and at once, in a passion, ordered him
to be flogged until he confessed. But as he could not confess that
he had taken the money and had none of his own to replace it, the
lash was continued until the wretch died under it. The Kaïd was set
free and restored to Mogador, and the informer’s son is now
assistant weigher at the Custom House, Mogador.</p>

<h3>SIX MOORISH FABLES.</h3>

<h4>1. <em>Fable of a Hedgehog and a Fox.</em></h4>

<p>Once upon a time a fox accidentally meeting a hedgehog addressed
him as follows, ‘I am much oppressed with thirst;’ to which the
hedgehog replied, ‘So am I, and I know a well where we can drink.’
The fox then said, ‘Come along.’ They travelled on till they
reached the well where they found two buckets worked by a pulley,
one ascending whilst the other descended. ‘Now,’ said the hedgehog,
‘I will go in first, and when I tell you, jump into the other
bucket.’ The hedgehog went down and had his drink, and then shouted
to the fox, ‘Now you jump in.’ He did as he was told, and as he
went down met the hedgehog coming up in the ascending bucket; upon
seeing which he said, ‘What does this mean?’ The hedgehog answered
thus, ‘It is the world goes round:’ and when he was safely at the
top, and the fox had reached the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_474">[474]</span> bottom, he called down to him and said,
‘Those who want to kill me I catch them in a trap, and to those who
do me a good turn I do the same to them.’</p>

<h4>2. <em>The Camel, the Hedgehog, and the Lion.</em></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a camel who met with a hedgehog, and
the camel tried to trample on him. The hedgehog said to the camel,
‘Wait till I call my brother, he is able to kill both you and me.’
‘No,’ said the camel, ‘if he comes he will perhaps kill me.’ ‘No,
no,’ said the hedgehog, ‘if you wish to see him, lie down on your
belly or on your back, open your mouth and let the flies come in,
and appear as if you were dead.’ The camel said, ‘All right.’
‘Well, well,’ said the hedgehog, ‘I will go call my brother.’ The
hedgehog went away to look for a lion, and meeting with one, said,
‘Your servant, my lord; there is a wild beast which wishes to eat
me.’ The lion replied, ‘Will he eat <em>me</em>?’ The hedgehog said
if he were there he certainly would; but he has gone away to get
food, ‘but my lord, if you would like to see what he has procured
for his breakfast, come along with me.’ The lion said, ‘You go
first.’ ‘Very well I will do so,’ said the hedgehog, ‘and when you
follow and get near, roar with all your might.’ The lion said, ‘All
right.’ The hedgehog said, ‘I shall go first.’ So away went the
hedgehog, and said to the camel, ‘Now, he is coming you lie still;
don’t stir or he will eat you.’ The camel said, ‘All right;’ and
whenever they heard the roarings of the lion, the camel said to the
hedgehog, ‘Listen to the noise he makes while talking.’ The lion
then drew nearer and roared again; when the camel exclaimed, ‘In
the name of the most merciful God, is he going to eat me?’ The
hedgehog said, ‘Don’t stir, don’t fear.’ The camel said, ‘All
right.’ They waited till the lion came, when the hedgehog addressed
him, and said, ‘This is a morsel of the breakfast the monster is
going to eat.’ The lion and the hedgehog now bade each other adieu;
and when the lion had departed the hedgehog said to the camel, ‘Now
you may get up, but tell me which of the two is master.’ The camel
replied, ‘It is you, it is you; good morning.’ The hedgehog said to
the camel, ‘Are you going away?’ The camel replied, ‘Yes, my lord,
I am;’ and from that day to this they have never spoken.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there were some hunters, who went out to hunt a
fairy embodied as a snake. The snake being pursued meeting with a
man passing by, said to him, ‘Will you afford me protection, for
there are hunters following, who want to catch me?’ The man
answered, ‘Very well,’ and allowed the snake to be concealed in his
clothes; presently the hunters came up to the man and asked him
whether he had seen a snake, to which he answered no, and the
hunters passed on in pursuit. After the hunters had left, the man
asked the snake to go down. The snake said, ‘No, and if you attempt
to force me down, I will kill you.’ The man said to the snake,
‘Very well, let us go to the Kadi and hear what the law says.’ The
snake said, ‘Very well, come along.’ So they went on till they came
to the hedgehog, who was Kadi; and the man said, ‘Your servant, my
lord; here is a snake that I have saved from the hunters, and I
have told him to get down, but he would not.’ The hedgehog
addressed the snake, and said, ‘I will decide the law for you, but
first get down.’ The snake at once got down, and then demanded of
the hedgehog what the law said. The Kadi then addressed the man as
follows: ‘The snake is on the ground and a stick is in your hand.’
The man, taking the hint, struck the snake on the head and killed
it.</p>

<h4>4. <em>The Sheep, the Fox, the Lion, and the
Shepherd.</em></h4>

<p>Once upon a time a fox met a lion, and the lion, addressing the
fox, said, ‘Will you be my servant to catch sheep for me? The fox
said, ‘I will, if you will give me my share.’ The lion said, ‘No,
and if you eat a single bit, I will kill you.’ ‘Very well,’ said
the fox, ‘if that is the bargain, I will agree to go hunt for you.’
So away went the fox and hunted about till he found some sheep, one
of which he killed and ate. He then went off to the owner of the
sheep and said, ‘The lion sent me to hunt your sheep for him, but I
would not do so, and he came<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_476">[476]</span> himself and ate one, and I have run to tell
you.’ ‘Very well,’ said the shepherd, ‘you shall be the guard over
my sheep, and let me know when the lion comes;’ and the fox said,
‘All right.’ So he waited till the evening, and then went to guard
the sheep; and whilst on guard he killed and devoured two more, and
afterwards, making a little wound in his own leg, he ran off to the
shepherd, and said, ‘The lion has come and eaten two sheep, and
wanted to eat me also; see the wound he made in my leg.’ The
shepherd said, ‘I see it is true; I will put two men to assist you
to guard.’ The fox said, ‘All right; I will go hunt for something
to eat, and then return.’ So he went off in search for the lion,
and meeting him, said, ‘I know where there are lots of sheep; they
are in such a place, you come in the evening to eat them.’ The lion
said, ‘All right.’ The fox then ran back to the shepherd, and said,
‘The lion is coming to-night,’ and directed the men who were to
assist in guarding to conceal themselves, but before doing so to
bring a big sack into which the fox put a great stone, and waited
till the lion came. When the lion came he said to the fox, ‘Why
have not you killed me a sheep?’ The fox said, ‘Because I was
afraid of a great monster that none but you can master, and there
he is in that sack; go in and kill him.’ The lion said, ‘All
right,’ and went in, when the fox tied securely the mouth of the
bag, so that the lion could not get out. The fox then said to the
lion, ‘Have you found him?’ The lion replied, ‘No, no, I have not,
and it is funny I cannot get out.’ The fox said, ‘Push away, try
and get out.’ The lion said, ‘I cannot.’ The fox said, ‘Probably
the monster holds you there.’ The fox said to the lion three times,
‘Can’t you get out?’ and three times the lion replied, ‘I cannot.’
The fox said, ‘He who wishes to kill me I catch him in a trap, and
to him who does good to me I will do good in return.’ So he went
away and called the guard, and said, ‘There he is, beat him;’ so
they beat him, and beat him till they were tired; and at last broke
his leg. The fox said to the guard, ‘Now let him out, he has broken
his leg and cannot escape;’ and when the lion got out the fox,
addressing him, said, ‘Now, which is master?’ The lion replied,
‘You are my master;’ and the fox said, ‘Whoever wishes to eat me at
one time will try again,’ and turned to the men and ordered them to
kill him. After which the fox said, ‘Now that we have killed the
lion, good-bye;’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">[477]</span>
and the men replied, ‘Good-bye.’ He went away, and waiting till
evening, and returning at supper time, he wounded the leg of each
remaining sheep, and ran off to the owner and said, ‘A monster
bigger than the last has come and wounded all your sheep.’ Previous
to this the fox went to the market, and bought a suit of clothes,
and sprinkled them with the blood of the sheep, and made it appear
as if the big monster of whom he spoke had also killed a man. He
then said to the owner, ‘All your sheep are spoiled; we had better
kill them and make a feast.’ So the shepherd killed the rest of the
sheep, and ate them with the fox; and when they had finished, the
fox filled a bowl with dirty water. The owner after he had finished
his breakfast, said, ‘What am I to do now? The sheep are killed.’
The fox said, ‘Now I will tell you how it all happened.’ The man
said, ‘How?’ The fox said, ‘Not till you open that door so that the
light is let in;’ and then said quickly, ‘It is I who killed your
sheep;’ he then threw the dirty water in his face, and made
off.</p>

<h4>5. <em>The Pigeon and the Monkey.</em></h4>

<p>Once upon a time as a pigeon was passing by he met with a
monkey. The monkey said to the pigeon, ‘Come, let us play;’ and the
pigeon said, ‘Very well, what shall we play at?’ The monkey put up
a stick and proposed they should get up it. The pigeon agreed, and
the monkey said, ‘Which shall go up first?’ The pigeon said,‘You.’
The monkey said, ‘All right,’ and tried but could not manage it;
upon which the pigeon immediately flew to the top. The pigeon said,
‘Now it is my turn to say, ‘What shall we next try?’ The monkey
said, ‘All right.’ So the pigeon challenged the monkey to tie his
tail to his leg, and when he had accomplished it, and untied it, he
said, ‘Come, let us see whether you can tie your wing to your leg.’
The pigeon said ‘All right,’ and fastened his wing to his leg, but
could not undo it; and the monkey devoured him.</p>

<h4>6. <em>The Hyena and the Hedgehog.</em></h4>

<p>Once upon a time there was a hedgehog travelling in quest of
something to eat, and saw a hyena coming towards him with intent to
devour him. As soon as the hyena had reached him,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_478">[478]</span> he said, ‘My lord, I observe
that you are dirty and stand in need of a bath, and if you require
one I have a bath at your service in my house.’ The hyena replied,
‘Yes, it is true, I am much troubled with fleas, please come along
and give it me; but first come to my house and breakfast, and then
we will go to the bath.’ The hedgehog said, ‘That is just what I
want, for I am out now looking for food.’ So the hedgehog went to
the hyena’s house and had his breakfast. The hedgehog then said,
‘Now come along and take your bath.’ The hyena said, ‘All right.’
So they went to the hedgehog’s house and the bath was heated to
boiling. The hedgehog said to the hyena, ‘Now jump into the bath,
and scratch yourself.’ So the hyena jumped in; whereupon the
hedgehog closed down the lid, and tied it with a string. The hyena
said, ‘This is too hot for me, I want to get out.’ ‘No, no,’ said
the hedgehog, ‘it is far better for you to be there than for me to
be in your belly; bawl away till you are dead.’</p>

the Kaïd of Mogador, by whom we were hospitably entertained soon
after our arrival. The father appears to have cumulated important
offices to an extent now rare, if not unknown, in Marocco. As the
Sultan’s hold over the province of Sous is very feeble, and limited
to the occasional receipt of tribute, there is no resident Kaïd,
but the title is given to any official sent, <i>pro hâc vice</i>,
to represent the Sultan. But the provinces of Duquallah and Abda,

<p class="center less space-below15"><em>On the Shelluh
Language.</em>
</p>

<p class="center less space-below15">By <span class="sc">John
Ball</span>.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Jackson</span> in his ‘Account of
Marocco’ refers to the opinion of Marmol, that the Shelluhs of
Marocco and the Berebers (Kabyles) of Algeria speak the same
language, as altogether incorrect, and positively affirms, on the
contrary, that these languages are quite distinct. In proof of this
assertion, he gives a short list of Shelluh words or short phrases,
with the Bereber equivalents of most of them, and concludes, from
the differences between these, that the languages are profoundly,
if not radically, different. A comparison of this kind is so
notoriously misleading that no importance would have been attached
to the conclusion derived from it, were it not for the fact that
Jackson was well acquainted with the Shelluh language, probably
better than any other European has since been; and that although
not versed in comparative philology, a science not yet come
into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">[479]</span> existence in
his time, he was a man of good general intelligence who seems to
have had frequent occasion to compare the two languages.</p>

<p>The first person who was able to speak on the subject with any
authority was Venture de Paradis, a man of remarkable linguistic
attainments, who died prematurely while accompanying the French
Syrian Expedition in 1799. His grammar and vocabulary of the
Bereber language were not published until 1844, and his conclusions
were not until then made known to the world. It appears that in the
year 1788 two Shelluhs, one a native of Haha, the other from Sous,
went to Paris. Notwithstanding the difficulty of communicating with
men who possessed no written language, Venture de Paradis contrived
to obtain from them a list of Shelluh words and short phrases. He
was very soon after attached to a mission sent to Algiers, where he
was detained for more than a year. He made acquaintance with two
Kabyles, theological students, at Algiers, and, finding that his
list of Shelluh words corresponded very nearly with the Kabyle
equivalents, he devoted himself to the study of the Kabyle dialect
of the Bereber tongue, and prepared the grammar and dictionary
which remained for more than half a century unpublished. It might
be sufficient to refer the reader to the judgment of so competent
an authority; but a slight examination of the subject has afforded
such confirmation to the conclusions of Venture de Paradis as seems
to place them beyond the reach of controversy.</p>

<p>It must be remarked in the first place that, from the want of
sacred books or other written records among the races of the
Bereber stock, there is no one of the many dialects spoken by them
that can be taken as the classical standard to which others may be
compared. French writers in treating of what they style ‘la langue
Berbère’ usually mean the Kabyle, spoken by most of the mountain
tribes of Algeria. The same language, with dialectic differences,
is used by many tribes of the Sahara; but throughout the larger
part of the vast region lying between the southern borders of
Algeria and Marocco and the Soudan, the prevailing tongue, though
unquestionably belonging to the Bereber family, deserves to rank as
a distinct language from the Kabyle. A slight examination of the
latter shows that it has been largely adulterated by contact with
the Arab population,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_480">[480]</span> who from an early period have ruled the
open country and carried on all commercial intercourse; while the
characteristic grammatical features have been in many respects
obscured or effaced. On the other hand, it appears from a recent
publication by General Faidherbe<a id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that the dialect spoken at
the south-western limit of the Bereber races, adjoining the river
Senegal, while preserving the chief Bereber grammatical
characteristics, has undergone much etymological alteration,
whether from contact with the Negro tribes, or from inherent
causes. As far as the available materials enable us to form a
judgment, it seems clear that the best living representative of the
Bereber language is that spoken by the Touarecks of the Great
Desert, and especially by the great tribes, the Azguer and Ahaggar,
who occupy between them a territory measuring at least half a
million of square miles. Of this, which is properly called
Tamashek’, a grammar was published by General Hanoteau in 1860, and
another by Mr. Stanhope Freeman in 1862. The Tamashek’ is
distinguished from the other languages of the same family by the
greater regularity and completeness of its grammatical system, by
the comparative absence of Arab words, of which the Kabyle shows a
large infusion; but especially by the possession of a system of
writing, rude, indeed, and imperfect, but not known to any other
branch of the Bereber stock. This privilege has not led to the
growth of a national literature; the written characters are used
only for rock inscriptions, for mottoes on shields, and
occasionally for verses on festive occasions; but their use is
widely spread among men of the higher class, and still more among
the women, and, however restricted, has doubtless tended to give
comparative fixity to the language.</p>

<p>Of the Shelluh tongue the materials available are, indeed, very
scanty. The most considerable document is contained in the ninth
volume of the ‘Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society,’ where
Mr. Francis Newman has given a literal Latin version of a story
written in Arabic characters by a native of South Marocco. It would
require far more knowledge of the Shelluh language and familiarity
with Arabic writing than I possess to enter on any examination of
that document; and there is the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_481">[481]</span> further difficulty that the natives who
learn to write their own language in Arabic characters are usually
those who also acquire the Arabic language, and in so doing learn
to adopt Arabic phrases and forms of speech. In the following table
I have introduced all the Shelluh words given by Jackson and
Washington, of which I have been able to find equivalents in Kabyle
or Tamashek’, and have endeavoured to adopt a uniform mode of
orthography. The vowels are intended to have the sounds to which
they correspond in most European languages, and not those peculiar
to England. <em>Th</em> and <em>sh</em> have nearly the same sounds
as in English; <em>gh</em> before <em>e</em> or <em>i</em> has the
hard sound; and <em>r’</em> indicates the peculiar sound
intermediate between the guttural and the ordinary <em>r</em>,
which European travellers indicate sometimes by <em>r</em>, and
sometimes by <em>gh</em>. In several instances synonyms are given
in brackets.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, as regards thirty out of thirty-five
Shelluh substantives here enumerated, the Kabyle equivalents are
distinguished only by dialectic differences, and the same holds as
to at least four out of six verbs. It thus appears, as far as the
evidence goes, that there is as much verbal resemblance between
these tongues as between Italian and Spanish, or other allied
languages belonging to the same stock. The comparison with the
Tamashek’ shows a less close etymological relationship. Out of
twenty-four substantives for which Tamashek’ equivalents have been
found, twelve only, and two only out of five verbs, show identity
of origin. But it is interesting to find indications that the
Shelluh retains a closer conformity to the rules of Tamashek’
grammar than does the better known Kabyle language. In the very few
cases where a comparison is possible we find, indeed, absolute
identity. Thus the Shelluh word for boy (<i>ayel</i>), is
apparently not found either in Kabyle or Tamashek;’ but the
feminine form (<i>tayelt</i>), for girl, precisely
follows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">[483]</span> the rule of
Tamashek’ inflexion for gender, and a slight modification of this
(<i>tehayalt</i>) is found in the Kabyle. A somewhat similar
example is the word <i>tasardount</i> for mule, this being the
regular feminine form of the Kabyle name, <i>aserdoun</i>. The word
<i>adrar</i> (mountain) forms its plural <i>idrarn</i> exactly
according to rule, and both singular and plural are identical with
the Tamashek’ forms; while the Kabyle shows dialectic differences,
especially in the plural where the final <em>r</em> of the singular
is lost. The last word in the list affords an illustration of the
liability to error incurred by a traveller attempting to form a
vocabulary of a language with which he has but a slight
acquaintance. <em>Good</em> is here used in the sense of a
satisfactory answer to inquiries, pretty much as <em>all right</em>
is adopted in colloquial English. Jackson was doubtless familiar
with the expression <i>egan ras</i>, which he gives as the Shelluh
equivalent, and which we also often heard from the natives; but the
<i>ras</i> of the Shelluh is obviously the same as the Tamashek’
adverb <i>r’as</i>, meaning <em>only</em>, or <em>exclusively</em>,
which invariably follows the word <i>elkir</i> in the corresponding
Tamashek’ reply, <i>elkir r’as</i>.</p>

<p>It has not appeared necessary to add to the table given above a
column for the corresponding words in the Zénaga language from the
vocabulary given by General Faidherbe. The amount of verbal
similarity between this and the Shelluh is very trifling, and the
distinguished author referred to was doubtless misinformed when led
to express a belief in their close connection.</p>

<p>The time is perhaps not yet come for forming a definitive
judgment as to the origin of the Bereber languages, and the precise
nature of the relations between them and the ancient language of
Egypt on the one hand, and those of the Semitic family on the
other. The present writer feels his own incompetence to grapple
with questions of such difficulty, and will merely refer the reader
to the conclusions recently announced by M. de Rochemonteix as
those which appear to carry with them the greatest weight.</p>

<p>In his essay, published in 1876,<a id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the learned writer finds
that the ancient Egyptian and the Bereber possessed the same
pronominal roots, and employed the same methods for
forming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">[484]</span> their
inflexions and derivatives; and he arrives at the same opinion with
reference to the inflexions of the substantives. He further asserts
that the modifications which time and external conditions have
effected are of a superficial character, and in no way conceal the
close grammatical affinity of these languages. Whether this
affinity be due to direct inheritance, or to common descent from a
more remote ancestral stock, is a question not touched by the
writer, who bases his conclusions on a study of two only of the
Bereber dialects, the Kabyle and the Tamashek.’<a id=
"FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>With reference to the relation indicated by the conjugation of
the Bereber verb, in which the grammatical processes show a
considerable affinity with those of the Semitic languages, while
the comparison of the verbal elements shows no token of common
origin, M. de Rochemonteix expresses the opinion that
at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">[485]</span> an early period
of their development, the Bereber people must have been brought
into contact with the Semitic stock, and may well have been struck
by the advantage of precision obtained by systematic conjugation of
the verb, and thus gradually moulded their own rude tongue on the
model supplied to them.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84"><span class=
"label">[3]</span></a>It is of some interest to remark that the
latest conclusions of philologists on the affinity of the North
African dialects, substantially agree with the testimony of the
earliest writer who came in contact with them. The following
passage is taken from the original version of the description of
Africa by Leo Africanus, published by Ramusio in his famous work
‘Delle Navigationi et Viaggi:’ Venetia, 1563, vol. i. p. 2 f. The
Moorish writer divides the indigenous white population of Northern
Africa into five races, enumerated by him, and then continues:
‘Tutti i cinque popoli—i quali sono divisi in centinaja di
legnaggi, et in migliaja di migliaja d’habitationi, insieme si
conformano in una lingua la quale comunemento è da loro detta Aquel
Amarig, che vuol dir lingua nobile. Et gli Arabi di Africa la
chiamano lingua barbaresca, che è la lingua africana nathia. Et
questa lingua è diversa et differente dalle altre lingue: tuttavia
in essa pur trovano alcuni vocaboli della lingua araba, di maniera
che alcuni gli tengono et usangli per testimonianza, che gli
Africani siano discesi dall’ origine d’i Sabei, popolo, come s’è
detto nell’ Arabia felice. Ma la parte contraria afferma, che
quelle voci arabe che si trovano nella detta lingua, furono recate
in lei dapoi che gli Arabi entrarono nell’ Africa, et la
possederono. Ma questi popoli furono di grosso inteletto et
ignoranti, intanto che niun libro lasciarono, che si possa addurre
in favore nè dell’ una nè dell’ altra parte. Hanno ancora qualche
differenza tra loro non solo nella pronontia, ma etiandio nella
signification di molti et molti vocaboli. Et quelli che sono più
vicini a gli Arabi, et più usano la domestichezza loro, più
similmente tengono de loro vocaboli arabi nella lingua. Et quasi
tutto il popolo di Gumera’ (the Rif Country) ‘usa la favella araba,
ma corrotta. Et molti della stirpe della gente di Haoara parlano
pure arabo, et tuttavia corrotta. Et ciò aviene per haver lunghi
tempi havuta conversazione con gli Arabi.’</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Learning</span> that a party of
English travellers had visited these ruins in the spring of 1878,
and believing that they had not been seen by any European traveller
since Jackson visited the place early in the present century, we
were anxious for information respecting them; and in reply to our
request we received an account of their visit kindly drawn up by
Messrs. W. H. Richardson and H. B. Brady, F.R.S. We have also been
favoured with the loan of a sketch executed by Mr. G. T. Biddulph,
who formed one of the same party, from which the vignette given
<a href="#Page_487" class="pginternal">p. 487</a> is taken.</p>

<p>After the notes were in the hands of the printer the appearance
in the ‘Academy,’ No. 32, p. 581, of a very full account of the
ruins by Dr. Leared, already well known as a successful Marocco
traveller, informed us that the ruins had been visited by him in
1877, in company with the members of the Portuguese mission to the
Sultan, and about the same time by some members of the German
Diplomatic Mission. Dr. Leared has fully succeeded in establishing
the identity of the so-called Castle, or Palace, of Pharaoh with
the Roman town of Volubilis, and has left little to be said on that
point. Nevertheless the ruins are interesting enough to make the
additional notes of other travellers useful and valuable; and we
have therefore availed ourselves of the greater part of the paper
kindly sent to us by Messrs. Richardson and Brady.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">[486]</span>‘One of the
points we had determined to visit on our tour was the ruin known by
the Moors as “Pharaoh’s Palace,” or “Pharaoh’s Tomb.” The time of
our journey was in some respects unfortunate for visiting places
held in veneration by the natives; we were, in fact, staying in Fez
at the time of Mohammed’s birthday, when religious fanaticism
exhibits itself, not merely in holidays and powder-play,
alternating with devotional exercises, but in processions to the
shrines of saints, and in sundry manifestations of ill-will to
unbelievers. We had considerable difficulty in obtaining
intelligible information as to the exact site of the ruins. Our
idea had been that they ought to have been accessible from the road
between Alcazar and Fez, striking off near Sidi Guiddar. The
interpreter and the mounted soldiers who were with us, overruled
this when it was proposed, and we therefore continued our journey.
They were probably right; but in our various conversations with
them on the subject they managed to convey the impression that
either they did not themselves know the precise locality, or that
they did not intend that we should visit the place.</p>

<p>‘During our stay in Fez we were joined by two Englishmen,
Messrs. G. T. Biddulph, and F. A. O’Brien, whose acquaintance we
had made in Tangier, and we proceeded to Mekinez in company.
Mekinez is a sort of Mecca to the Aissowies—the most fanatical of
all the sects of western Mohammedans—and the road was thronged with
devotees returning from their annual pilgrimage to the city of
Mohammed-ben-Aissa, their prophet. We were kindly received by the
Lieutenant Bashaw (Kaïd Hamo), who seemed desirous to forward our
views in every way in his power. He thought it necessary on our
departure to provide us with a soldier who knew the district
thoroughly, so that altogether we had a guard of four regular
soldiers. Thus furnished, the tone of our interpreter changed, and
we had no more obstacles thrown in our way.</p>

<p>‘We proposed to make the Roman station the first stage on our
road from Mekinez to Rabat. Whether it would have been better to
have taken it, as we had originally intended, on the way to Fez, or
subsequently, between Fez and Mequinez, it is needless now to
inquire; it certainly is a good deal out of the direct route
between Mekinez and Rabat, if maps are to be trusted. However, we
got on the way on March 23 a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_487">[487]</span> little after 10 <span class=
"sc2">A.M.</span> The site of the ruin is some fifteen miles
north-west of Mekinez, at no great distance from Mouley Edris el
Kebir; both are on the southern slopes of one of the ranges that
constitute the Lesser Atlas. There was little of interest by the
way. Part of the road was on the horizon of a bed of white,
friable, microzoic, tertiary limestone, which forms a conspicuous
feature in the mountain strata of this district. This is traceable
for a great distance, and its exposure at one or two points in the
heights to the far east, we had at first mistaken</p>

<p class="less">Roman ruins of Volubilis.</p>

<p class="nind">for snow. After about four hours’ riding we had to
diverge from the main road; and here we learned that it would be
necessary to encamp at some distance to the south-west, in the last
<i>douar</i> within the government of Mekinez. The hill-country, it
was said, was so infested by a lawless set of Berebers that we
should not be safe out of the jurisdiction of the Bashaw. Before
the evening was out we had reason to know that these fears were not
entirely groundless. Leaving our servants with the luggage,
therefore, we took two soldiers and rode across country to the
object of our journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">[488]</span>‘The ruins stand
on a little hill, a mile or more from the road. At the base of the
hill runs a bright little mountain stream. The ground for many
acres is strewed and heaped with squared stones, the débris of
ancient buildings; lines of wall-foundations appear in every
direction, and pillar bases in rows or squares, arranged as though
for the support of colonnades surrounding courts or <i>patios</i>.
The demolition is no doubt largely due to spoliation, but it is
also partly the result of the unstable character of the mortar,
which has to a great extent weathered out from between the stones.
In some of the walls still standing the stones appear to retain
their places by their own weight rather than by the help of any
cement that is left to hold them together. Two perfect Roman arches
still remain, and one or two nearly complete, but even these look
as though they might not long withstand the mountain winds.’<a id=

<p>‘In the present condition of the place it is impossible even to
guess what was the original ground-plan of the buildings. The
principal frontage appears to have had the west aspect, and there
is still the remnant of a sort of façade. Amongst the fallen stones
of this front is part of an entablature which has borne an
inscription in four lines. We could only find one stone of it; and
this bore the following letters, about eight inches in height.
There were the shafts of many marble columns amongst the fallen
stones, and not a few capitals, some simple, others more or less
carved with volutes, Ionic fashion, and one at least with the
remnant of acanthus leaves, as though derived from a Corinthian
building. Some of the mouldings had the common egg and arrow
ornament, and there was a portion of a narrow frieze on the western
side with one of the common frets of classic architecture formed of
a double series of interlacing</p>

<div class="figcenter iw3">
<figure class="iw3" id="i21"><img src='images/i21.jpg' alt=''>
</figure>
</div>

<p class="nind">curved lines; but beyond these there was but little
decorative sculpture. There is clearly a basement storey of very
large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">[489]</span> stones lying
underneath the present ground level. Here and there the subsidence
of the ground, or the falling in of the masonry, reveals passages
and what appear to be small rooms or vaults, with solid, well
constructed walls. In the short hour that circumstances permitted
us to linger, it was impossible to do more than observe things as
they stood. The mere removal of the loose stones would do a good
deal, and a very little excavation would do much more, to indicate
the history of the original structures, and we have little doubt
that many inscribed stones might still be found that would help
materially to the same end. On the north side of the western arch
and façade is a sort of enclosure formed of loose stones piled
together as a rude wall, and whitewashed. This wall has been reared
by pilgrims, each of whom has carried and placed a stone, according
to their custom, at what they regard as a “saint’s place.”’</p>

<p>Up to the year 1877 no traveller appears to have visited the
ruins since Jackson, who twice refers to them in his ‘Account of
the Empire of Marocco.’ In a note to p. 21 (3rd Edition, 1814) he
says: ‘The father of the Sultan Sulieman built a magnificent palace
on the banks of the river of Tafilelt, which bounds his dominions
on the eastward; the pillars are of marble, and many of them were
transported across the Atlas, having been collected from the (Ukser
Farawan) Ruins of Pharaoh near the sanctuary of Muly Dris Zerone,
west of Atlas.’ In another place (p. 146) he says: ‘When I visited
these ruins in my journey from the sanctuary of Muly Dris Zerone,
near to which they are situated, in the plain below, the jealousy
of the (Stata) protecting guide sent by the Fakeers to see me safe
to the confines of their district was excited, and he endeavoured
to deter me from making any observations by insinuating that the
place was the haunt of large and venomous serpents, scorpions,
&amp;c. A good number of cauldrons and kettles filled with gold and
silver coins have been excavated from these ruins.’</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing

provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
